# The Corporate Wars

_The Corporate Wars_ thrusts players into a distant future where humanity has conquered the stars—yet remains locked in an endless struggle for control over wealth, power, and the flow of information.

Across the vast gulf of space, instant communication is a fantasy. Trade routes aren’t just lifelines for goods—they’re the arteries of civilization, carrying data, secrets, and influence. In this fragile web, economic decentralization isn’t just inevitable—it’s an opportunity waiting to be exploited. Corporations navigate ruthless logistical constraints and the ever-tightening grip of galactic powers desperate to keep their hold on interstellar commerce.

Here, industry, finance, and trade aren’t just the gears of progress—they’re weapons in a war fought in boardrooms and back alleys alike. From stock market sabotage to the quiet conquest of entire star systems, every move shifts the balance of power. Diplomacy is a mask for coercion, and information is the deadliest currency in a battlefield where fortunes rise and fall at the speed of commerce.

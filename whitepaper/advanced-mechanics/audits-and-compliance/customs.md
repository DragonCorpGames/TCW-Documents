# Customs

Customs enforcement is **the most common and frequent form of inspection and regulation** in _The Corporate Wars_, directly impacting **interstellar trade and corporate logistics**. Any **established star system** imposes **controls over incoming and outgoing goods**, regulating **the flow of commerce, imposing tariffs, and ensuring that no prohibited or hazardous cargo crosses its borders unchecked**.

For corporations, customs can be either a **bureaucratic obstacle or a strategic tool** to control rivals. In **highly regulated systems**, clearing goods may require **lengthy paperwork, import duties, and thorough inspections**, delaying operations and increasing costs. Meanwhile, in **less regulated sectors or trade-friendly ports**, **minimal enforcement or the right connections** can **significantly reduce or even bypass** these barriers.

Customs inspections **aren’t limited to cargo**—they extend to **crews and passengers as well**. Local authorities conduct **identity checks, verify operational permits, and in some cases, detain or deport individuals** who fail to meet entry requirements. Corporations relying on **fluid supply chains** must **understand the regulations of each port** and, when necessary, find **ways to expedite** the process—whether through **official agreements or unofficial incentives**.

**Smuggling is an inseparable reality of customs enforcement**. Restrictions on **certain goods—whether for political, technological, or security reasons—create a lucrative black market** where **evading inspections is often more profitable than complying with them**.

Some corporations **allocate resources to ensuring their cargo clears customs without interference**, while others **operate at the fringes of legality**, refining **methods to bypass security checkpoints** without leaving a trace.

In a universe where **commerce dictates power**, navigating **customs barriers** is **just as critical as the product being transported**. The **ability to manipulate, bypass, or master interstellar customs** can mean the difference between **a thriving corporate empire and a supply chain strangled by red tape**.

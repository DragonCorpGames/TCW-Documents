# Suppression

In **The Corporate Wars**, suppression is the deliberate act of neutralizing individuals, groups, or movements whose existence or influence threatens the interests of a Polity or corporation. Unlike sabotage or propaganda, suppression acts directly on the target, removing their ability to act through intimidation, isolation, or covert force. Emerging unions, charismatic leaders, troublesome scientists, or rebellious factions can become priority targets when their actions threaten to disrupt the established balance of power.

These operations rarely leave an obvious trace. The disappearance of a local leader, an unexpected accident, or the sudden collapse of a social movement are often the result of precise maneuvers, executed solely to preserve the status quo. In many cases, suppression does not require the physical elimination of the target; ruining their reputation, cutting off their funding, or exposing them to their own allies is often enough to render them inactive. In an environment where information travels slowly and truths are fragile, suppression is a subtle yet definitive tool, designed to silence without the need for a shot to be fired.

# Sabotage

In **The Corporate Wars**, sabotage is one of the most direct and effective ways to alter the balance of power without the need to deploy military forces. Attacking a rival's infrastructure, assets, or operations from within allows for deep, hard-to-trace damage, affecting production, transportation, or security at the most critical moments. A failure at a fueling station, a malfunction in a cargo ship, or the loss of data at an administrative hub can trigger devastating consequences on an interstellar scale.

These actions are rarely carried out openly. The true value of sabotage lies in its ability to go unnoticed, to sow chaos while everything appears to be a mere accident, a technical failure, or a poor decision. Agents, often infiltrated or hired by third parties, operate quietly, leaving behind economic losses, logistical delays, and internal distrust. In a universe where time and reliability are everything, the shadow of sabotage is a constant threat, always lurking in the spots where a single spark can ignite an uncontrollable fire.

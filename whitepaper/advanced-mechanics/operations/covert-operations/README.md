# Covert Operations

In **The Corporate Wars**, Covert Operations represent the darker and more subtle side of interstellar competition. Far from open markets and official trade routes, corporations, governments, and cartels resort to intelligence, manipulation, and indirect action to tip the balance in their favor. In this realm, the boundaries between war, politics, and crime blur, and decisions are made in the shadows, where controlling information and the precise use of resources can be more decisive than a combat fleet.

Covert operations range from intelligence gathering and analysis to financial disruption and large-scale propaganda. They also include the deployment of strategic assets to influence or destabilize key regions, as well as the creation and maintenance of ties with criminal networks capable of executing actions such as smuggling, industrial sabotage, or the direct suppression of hostile elements. These tools allow Polities to operate where laws or conventional diplomacy are ineffective, projecting power without the need for an open war declaration.

Each move in this field carries considerable risks. The exposure of an operation could trigger reprisals, sanctions, or disrupt the delicate balance of power in an entire star system. Therefore, Covert Operations are the domain of specialists and trained agents, capable of acting in complex scenarios where loyalty, information, and initiative are worth more than any cargo of resources or the size of a fleet.

# Intelligence

In **The Corporate Wars**, intelligence is a game of patience, precision, and calculated risks, conditioned by distance and the impossibility of transmitting information faster than light. Gathering data on rival movements, hidden resources, or political changes requires deploying agents, probes, and local networks that operate autonomously over long periods, collecting and storing information until it can be transmitted back to their command. Each report can take months or even years to cross space, and by then, the situation on the ground may have changed entirely.

For this reason, the true advantage lies not in immediate data, but in the ability to project patterns, anticipate movements, and establish self-sustaining intelligence networks. The most skilled corporations and powers do not only seek to know the facts but aim to plant their own assets in key locations: informants in government councils, undercover agents among commercial crews, or listening stations at strategic points along trade routes. Intelligence thus becomes a long-range game, where the most valuable information is not the one obtained by chance, but the one built over years of investment and patient manipulation.

In this environment, uncertainty and data fragmentation are the norm. Decisions are made based on incomplete reports, rumors, and projections, and each reconnaissance mission is a gamble with real costs and risks. Information becomes a strategic asset with its own economic and political weight, capable of deciding the fate of entire worlds long before fleets or markets come into play.

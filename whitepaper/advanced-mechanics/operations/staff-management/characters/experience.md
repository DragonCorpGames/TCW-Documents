# Experience

Every profession follows a development cycle based on accumulated experience and acquired specialization. Characters advance in their careers through additional training, achievements in their field, and the ability to adapt to market demands.

However, career progression is not guaranteedâ€”opportunities for promotion and diversification depend on access to resources, industry demand, and the stability of the employing corporation. Those who navigate these factors effectively can rise to positions of leadership, expand their expertise, or pivot into new high-value roles, securing their place in the ever-shifting corporate landscape.

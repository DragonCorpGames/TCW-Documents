# Careers

In **The Corporate Wars**, a character’s career represents a life path shaped by the society they come from and the opportunities they’ve had access to. Each character follows a professional trajectory that defines their skills, experience, and value within the corporate structure — with career paths that can lead them from operational roles to leadership positions in their respective specialties.

Professional careers span a wide range of disciplines, from administration and commerce to exploration and security. Some characters start in technical fields, becoming engineers, scientists, or logistics specialists, while others pursue careers in finance, diplomacy, or corporate strategy. There are also military and paramilitary paths, where combat experience and tactical operations are essential for asset protection and conflict resolution.

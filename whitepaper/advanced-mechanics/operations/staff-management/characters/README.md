# Characters

**Characters** represent the highly specialized workforce within **The Corporate Wars** — professionals with advanced training and experience who are essential to corporate operations. Their availability depends on the strength of local labor markets and the level of education and professional development on their home worlds, limiting the number of individuals with unique profiles and specific skill sets.

Each character possesses a particular combination of abilities, although at lower levels, diversity narrows, resulting in more common profiles within the corporate structure. Demand for these specialized workers is high, and hiring them can make a significant difference in a company's operational efficiency and competitive advantage. However, their scarcity forces corporations to compete for talent or invest in developing their own workforce to ensure a steady flow of specialists.

Access to these professionals is a strategic factor in personnel management. Companies that succeed in attracting and retaining the most skilled individuals will optimize their operations and adapt more quickly to the challenges of the interstellar environment — securing their dominance in a market where knowledge and experience are as valuable as any other asset.

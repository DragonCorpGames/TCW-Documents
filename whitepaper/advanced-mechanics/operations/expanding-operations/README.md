# Expanding Business

Growth is the only viable strategy for any corporation aspiring to supremacy in **The Corporate Wars**. Corporate activities cannot remain static — they must constantly expand to ensure competitiveness and long-term survival. Whether increasing production capacity, diversifying operations, or securing new concessions in strategic systems, expansion is both a necessity and an opportunity.

Business consolidation is not always limited to a single industry. The most successful corporations pursue both vertical and horizontal integration — acquiring key suppliers, establishing new trade routes, or investing in emerging sectors before the competition. In some cases, expansion happens through the direct purchase of assets and the absorption of smaller companies, while in others, it is achieved through strategic alliances or licenses that allow operations in regulated markets without massive upfront investments.

Growth comes with challenges. Regulations may become stricter as a corporation gains influence, and rivalries with other entities can escalate into open conflicts for sector dominance. However, stagnation is not an option in an environment where competition is fierce and opportunities are limited. Only companies capable of expanding their operations intelligently will consolidate their power and secure their future in the interstellar economy.

# Operations

Beyond initial permits and regulations, **operations** define how a corporation generates revenue and expands its influence across the galaxy. Every company must manage resources, infrastructure, and personnel to stay competitive in a hostile and ever-changing environment.

Operations span multiple sectors, from the production and manufacturing of goods to resource extraction on planets and asteroid belts. Interstellar trade and transportation connect markets and exploit strategic routes, while services like private security, banking, and technological research provide crucial competitive advantages. Expansion requires investment in infrastructure and logistics, building everything from space stations to entire colonies.

Corporate growth is never without challenges: aggressive competition, market fluctuations, government intervention, and covert conflicts are all part of daily operations. Only those who optimize their operations, diversify risks, and adapt to shifting conditions will rise to become true titans of interstellar commerce.

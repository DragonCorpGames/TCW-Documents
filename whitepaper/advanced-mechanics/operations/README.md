# Operations

Beyond initial permits and regulations, operations define how a corporation generates income and expands its influence across the galaxy. Each company must manage resources, infrastructure, and personnel to remain competitive in a hostile and ever-changing environment.

Operations span multiple sectors â€” from the production and manufacturing of goods to resource extraction on planets and asteroid belts. Interstellar trade and transport connect markets and exploit strategic routes, while services such as private security, banking, and technological research provide critical competitive advantages. Expansion requires investment in infrastructure and logistics, building everything from space stations to entire colonies.

Corporate growth is never without challenges: aggressive competition, market fluctuations, government intervention, and covert conflicts are part of everyday life. Only those able to optimize operations, diversify risks, and adapt to changing conditions can consolidate their position as true titans of interstellar trade.

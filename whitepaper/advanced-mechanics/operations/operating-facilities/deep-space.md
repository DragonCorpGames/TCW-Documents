# Far Orbit and Deep Space

Corporate operations in **deep orbit and outer space** offer a level of **freedom rarely found** on the surface of inhabited worlds. Beyond the dense web of planetary regulations, these installations operate with **greater independence**, becoming **strategic enclaves** for production, trade, and advanced research. In some systems, **outer-orbit stations** serve as the **primary hubs of economic activity**, acting as **gateways between emerging civilizations and the interstellar trade routes**. In other cases, **facilities positioned far from regulated traffic** provide **safe havens** for enterprises seeking to operate beyond external interference.

Orbital stations function as **self-sustaining industrial platforms**, processing raw materials **extracted within the system** or **imported from distant sectors**. From **shipyards dedicated to construction and maintenance** to **refineries specializing in gas and mineral conversion**, these facilities enable corporations to **maintain continuous production** without relying on **planetary infrastructure**. On worlds with **limited access to advanced technology**, these stations **become the only gateway** to goods and services that local governments **cannot yet provide**.

In the **vast, unclaimed regions of space**, economic activity takes on **different forms**. **Floating supply platforms** positioned at strategic points provide ships with **resources without requiring port access** in **regulated worlds**. **Research labs** conduct **experiments that would be impossible under constant oversight**. Some stations **specialize in storage and cargo transfer**, acting as **temporary depots for interplanetary trade**, facilitating discreet transactions far from **bureaucratic restrictions**.

While **distance from power centers** offers **advantages**, it also presents **challenges**. These facilities must be **self-sufficient**, with **maintenance systems capable of running independently** of external supply chains. **Security becomes a critical concern**, as **official protection is scarce**, forcing corporations to **rely on their own forces** to defend their assets.

Despite the risks, the **growth potential and operational flexibility** of **deep-space facilities** make them an **essential component of any interstellar economic empire**. For corporations with **grand ambitions**, these **remote outposts are not just assets—they are opportunities to reshape the galaxy’s commercial landscape**.

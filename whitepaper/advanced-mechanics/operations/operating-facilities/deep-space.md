# Far Orbit and Deep Space

Operations in outer orbit and deep space offer corporations a level of freedom rarely found on the surfaces of inhabited worlds. Beyond the dense planetary control networks, these installations can operate with greater independence, becoming strategic enclaves for production, trade, and advanced research. In some systems, outer orbital stations serve as the main economic hubs, acting as links between emerging civilizations and interstellar trade routes. In other cases, complexes located far from regulated traffic zones provide refuge for companies seeking to operate without external interference.

Orbital stations can function as self-sufficient industrial platforms, processing raw materials extracted from the same system or imported from distant sectors. From shipyards dedicated to the construction and maintenance of spacecraft to refineries specializing in gas and mineral conversion, these facilities enable corporations to maintain steady production without relying on planetary infrastructure. On worlds with limited access to advanced technology, these stations may represent the only gateway to products and services their governments cannot yet provide.

In vast regions of space with no clear jurisdiction, economic activity can take other forms. Supply platforms float at strategic points, providing goods to ships in transit without requiring them to dock at regulated ports. Research laboratories operate under conditions impossible in environments subject to constant inspections. Some stations specialize in the storage and transfer of goods, serving as temporary depots for interplanetary trade.

While distance from centers of power offers certain advantages, it also presents challenges. Installations must be self-sufficient, with maintenance systems capable of operating without a constant flow of external supplies. Security becomes a major concern, as access to official protection is limited and corporations must rely on their own forces to defend their assets. Despite these risks, the potential for growth and operational flexibility makes these enclaves an essential component of any economic empire with interstellar ambitions.

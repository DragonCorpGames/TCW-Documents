# Building and Construction

Facilities are the physical foundation of any corporation in **The Corporate Wars**. From planetary surface factories to deep-orbit starports, each piece of infrastructure plays a strategic role in the expansion and consolidation of an interstellar enterprise. Without a well-planned network of buildings and structures, corporate growth will be limited by logistical challenges, production constraints, and aggressive competition.

Constructing buildings requires time, materials, and capital, with costs varying based on multiple factors. On planets with developed infrastructure, costs may decrease thanks to the availability of local supplies and labor. However, in remote colonies or resource-scarce zones, companies must import materials and hire specialized personnel, significantly raising the initial investment. Environmental conditions — such as gravity, climate, or atmospheric composition — can also impact project viability, requiring adapted technologies for hostile environments.

Every building needs energy, maintenance, and an adequate workforce to operate efficiently. Depending on location and facility type, energy may come from local reactors, planetary power grids, or autonomous systems like solar panels or fusion generators. Workforce availability can also be limited, forcing corporations to rely on automation, robotics, or importing specialized workers to meet operational demands. In some cases, companies may depend on contracts with local governments or interstellar unions, adding extra layers of complexity to human resource management.

Construction timelines vary according to available technology and existing system infrastructure. On advanced worlds, buildings can be assembled quickly using prefabricated modules or structural printing. In early-stage colonies — where every structure must be built from scratch and materials imported at great cost — projects can take years. During this process, corporations must carefully plan supply logistics to ensure a constant flow of materials and tools, avoiding delays that could impact profitability.

Beyond direct costs, building and maintaining infrastructure is a strategic decision. Facilities can become production, trade, or research hubs, attracting investment and talent. However, they can also become targets for attacks, sabotage, or territorial disputes — especially in regions with ambiguous regulations or the presence of independent actors. Proximity to trade routes, access to natural resources, and the surrounding political stability are critical factors when deciding where to build, as poor location choices can lead to unmanageable logistics costs or excessive vulnerability to local conflicts.

Proper infrastructure planning is key to success. A well-managed network of factories, logistics centers, storage facilities, and space stations allows a corporation to optimize operations, reduce costs, and strengthen its position in interstellar trade. In a universe where logistics define business viability, mastering facility construction and management is essential for any company aspiring to supremacy in the interstellar markets.

# Building and Construction

Facilities are the physical backbone of any corporation in _The Corporate Wars_. From planetary surface factories to deep-orbit starports, every piece of infrastructure plays a strategic role in the expansion and consolidation of an interstellar enterprise. Without a well-planned network of buildings and structures, corporate growth is hindered by logistical bottlenecks, production constraints, and relentless competition.

Constructing facilities requires time, materials, and capital, with costs varying based on numerous factors. In well-developed planets, expenses may be reduced due to local labor and readily available supplies. However, in remote colonies or resource-scarce regions, corporations must import materials and hire specialized personnel, significantly increasing initial investment. Environmental conditions—gravity, climate, and atmospheric composition—further influence project feasibility, often demanding adaptive technology for hostile environments.

Every facility requires energy, maintenance, and a capable workforce to operate efficiently. Energy sources depend on location and infrastructure: local reactors, planetary grids, or autonomous systems such as solar arrays or fusion generators. Workforce availability is another challenge—some corporations rely on automation, robotics, or imported specialists to fill operational gaps. In many cases, businesses must negotiate contracts with local governments or interstellar unions, adding another layer of complexity to human resource management.

Construction timelines depend on available technology and system infrastructure. Advanced worlds can deploy prefabricated modules or structural printing for rapid assembly, while nascent colonies may take years to complete projects due to high import costs and manual labor requirements. Corporations must carefully orchestrate supply chains, ensuring a continuous flow of materials and tools to prevent costly delays that could impact profitability.

Beyond direct costs, infrastructure development is a strategic move. Well-placed facilities become powerhouses of production, trade, and research, attracting investment and talent. However, they can also become prime targets for attacks, sabotage, or territorial disputes, especially in regions with ambiguous regulations or the presence of rogue factions. Proximity to trade routes, natural resources, and political stability are critical factors in determining where to build—poor location choices can lead to crippling logistics costs or heightened vulnerability to local conflicts.

Proper infrastructure planning is the cornerstone of success. A well-managed network of factories, logistics hubs, storage facilities, and space stations enables corporations to streamline operations, cut costs, and secure a dominant foothold in interstellar commerce. In a universe where logistics dictate business viability, mastering the construction and management of facilities is an indispensable requirement for any enterprise striving for supremacy in the galactic marketplace.

# Operating Facilities

Facilities are the operational backbone of any corporation in _The Corporate Wars_. From manufacturing plants to strategic starports, every piece of infrastructure defines a company’s capacity for expansion and market dominance. Operating facilities is not just about building them—it’s about maintaining, optimizing, and protecting them to ensure sustained functionality in a fiercely competitive environment.

Each type of facility serves a distinct purpose: **production centers** manufacture goods, **commercial and logistics infrastructure** handles transport and storage, **R\&D labs** develop new technologies, and **space stations and shipyards** secure control over interstellar trade routes.

Efficient management demands constant oversight of maintenance, security, operational costs, and automation, ensuring a balance between productivity and profitability. However, expansion comes with challenges—government interference, corporate sabotage, and external threats can turn any facility into a high-value target.

Only those corporations that can optimize their resources and adapt to shifting conditions will be able to operate facilities effectively, cementing their presence across the galaxy.

# Operating Facilities

Facilities are the operational backbone of any corporation in **The Corporate Wars**. From production factories to strategic starports, each piece of infrastructure defines a corporation’s capacity for expansion and market dominance. Operating facilities involves not only building them but also maintaining, optimizing, and protecting them to ensure continuous performance in a competitive environment.

Each type of facility serves a specific role: production centers manufacture goods, commercial and logistics infrastructure manages transport and storage, R\&D labs develop new technologies, and space stations and shipyards secure control over interstellar routes.

Efficient management requires constant oversight of maintenance, security, operational costs, and automation — balancing productivity and profitability. However, expansion brings challenges: from government interference to corporate sabotage, every facility can become a strategic target.

Only corporations that successfully optimize their resources and adapt to changing conditions will operate facilities effectively, securing their presence across the galaxy.

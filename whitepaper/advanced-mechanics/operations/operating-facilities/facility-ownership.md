# Facility Ownership

Corporations in **The Corporate Wars** possess a wide range of properties that go beyond buildings and facilities. Their assets can include fleets of starships, territories on strategic planets, mining concessions in asteroid belts, rights over trade routes, and participation in financial markets through stocks and securities. These properties represent not just wealth, but also influence and control within the interstellar economy.

Owning a fleet of starships is one of the most strategic investments for any corporation. Ships may serve as freighters dedicated to trade, armed escorts protecting assets, or even mobile production platforms. In many cases, corporations prefer leasing their ships to third parties or establishing long-term contracts, allowing their use without transferring ownership. This ensures steady revenue while avoiding direct operational risks.

The financial market is another critical arena where corporations exercise power. Through stock purchases and investment fund participation, they can gain influence over rival companies or diversify their capital without directly engaging in specific sectors. In some cases, they may license technological patents or sell shares of their operations on the market, maintaining majority control while securing external funding.

Exploitation rights are also a highly valuable form of property. On certain planets or space stations, a corporation may not own the land but hold exclusive rights to extract resources, operate supply centers, or manage transportation networks. These agreements can be temporary or renewable and are often contested by other entities seeking more favorable terms or aiming to seize market control.

The concept of property in space is complex, and in many cases, usage rights and exclusivity are more important than direct ownership. Corporations can generate enormous profits not by owning physical assets, but by controlling access and exploitation rights. Through concessions, franchises, and strategic leases, a company can expand its influence without bearing maintenance costs â€” turning its properties into key weapons in the interstellar economic war.

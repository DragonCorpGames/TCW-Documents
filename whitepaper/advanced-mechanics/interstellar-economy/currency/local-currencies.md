# Local Currencies

Despite the dominance of the Credit (Cr) in interstellar trade, many societies maintain their own local currencies, primarily used for internal transactions and planetary commerce. These currencies, managed by planetary or regional governments, reflect the unique economies and cultures of each world. They are widely accepted in local markets, payroll systems, and small-scale economic activities.

However, their value is often influenced by factors such as political stability, access to essential goods, and their connection to interstellar trade. In isolated worlds or frontier systems, local currencies can fluctuate drastically in value, directly impacting the cost of living and the viability of commercial operations.

For corporations operating across multiple systems, managing local currencies requires constant conversions, value fluctuations, and strategic financial adjustments. While large-scale transactions are typically conducted in Credits, understanding and controlling local currencies is crucial for establishing successful operations and ensuring economic stability in the regions they serve.

# Local Currencies

Despite the predominance of the **Credit (Cr)** in interstellar trade, many societies maintain their own local currencies, used primarily for internal transactions and planetary commerce. These currencies, managed by planetary or regional governments, reflect the specific economies and cultures of each world and are accepted in local markets, salary payments, and small-scale economic activities.

However, their value often depends on factors such as political stability, access to essential goods, and connection to interstellar trade. On isolated worlds or frontier systems, local currencies can fluctuate drastically in value, directly impacting the cost of living and the viability of commercial operations.

For corporations operating across multiple systems, managing local currencies involves constant conversions, value fluctuations, and adjustments to financial strategies. While most large-scale transactions use Credits, understanding and controlling local currencies is key to establishing successful operations and ensuring economic stability in the regions where they operate.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Local currencies are not SPL tokens, but a value that determines the exchange rate between the local economy and the interstellar economy. On the other hand, star systems with economies integrated into interstellar society have such high exchange rates and inflation that they abandon the use of local currencies in favor of Credit.

# Currency

The interstellar economy of **The Corporate Wars** is built on a network of monetary systems that includes both a standard intergalactic currency, widely used for interstellar transactions, and local currencies present on specific worlds and systems. These currencies reflect the diversity of galactic economies, providing a financial framework for both regional trade and large-scale operations.

Despite their complementary nature, each type of currency plays a distinct role in the galactic economy. While currencies like the Credit (Cr) serve as the primary medium of exchange between worlds and sectors, local currencies maintain economic and cultural stability within individual systems. The Credit offers uniformity and transactional ease for interplanetary contracts, while local currencies allow planetary economies to function with a degree of independence, adapting to local economic and political conditions.

Together, these currencies form the foundation of the interstellar economy. Corporations, merchants, and governments must manage both to ensure economic viability, anticipate market fluctuations, and seize strategic opportunities. This balance is crucial for navigating the intricate economic landscape of **The Corporate Wars**.

# Currency

The interstellar economy of _The Corporate Wars_ is built upon a network of monetary systems, encompassing both a standardized intergalactic currency—widely used for interstellar transactions—and local currencies that circulate within specific worlds and systems. These diverse currencies reflect the vast economic landscape of the galaxy, providing a financial framework for both regional trade and large-scale operations.

Despite their complementary nature, each type of currency plays a distinct role in the galactic economy. The Credit (Cr) serves as the primary medium of exchange across worlds and sectors, ensuring uniformity and ease of transaction in interplanetary contracts. Meanwhile, local currencies sustain economic and cultural stability within individual systems, allowing planetary economies to operate with a degree of independence, adapting to their unique political and financial conditions.

Together, these currencies form the foundation of interstellar commerce. Corporations, merchants, and governments must skillfully navigate both systems to maintain economic viability, anticipate market fluctuations, and seize strategic opportunities. Striking this balance is crucial for surviving the intricate financial landscape of _The Corporate Wars_.

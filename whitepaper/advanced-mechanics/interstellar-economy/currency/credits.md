# Credits

The **Credit (Cr)** is the basic unit of value in the interstellar economy. All transactions — from daily trade to interstellar agreements — are calculated in Credits. This universal standard allows corporations, governments, and merchants to negotiate in clear and consistent terms, eliminating the complications of multiple local monetary systems.

When figures reach massive proportions, the abbreviation **MCr (MegaCredits)** is used to represent millions of Credits, simplifying the understanding and recording of large-scale investments. Nevertheless, the Credit itself remains the fundamental unit, present in all economic activities throughout the galaxy.

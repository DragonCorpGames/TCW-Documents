# Credits

The Credit (Cr) is the fundamental unit of value in the interstellar economy. Every transaction, from daily trade to intersystem agreements, is calculated in Credits. This universal standard allows corporations, governments, and merchants to negotiate in clear, consistent terms, eliminating the complications of dealing with multiple local monetary systems.

When figures reach massive proportions, the abbreviation MCr (MegaCredits) is used to represent millions of Credits, streamlining the comprehension and record-keeping of large-scale investments. Despite this, the Credit itself remains the bedrock of all economic activity across the galaxy, ever-present in every financial exchange.

# Route Income

Route income represents the amount of credits generated from interstellar trade between two star systems. This calculation helps assess the profitability of a trade connection, determining whether a route is sustainable, lucrative, or operating at a loss.

Revenue depends on multiple factors, including bilateral traffic volume, demand for transported goods, starport fees, and associated operational costs. High-trade routes tend to generate greater profits and attract infrastructure investments, while low-traffic routes may require subsidies or incentives to remain active.

A routeâ€™s economic stability also affects transport frequency and the availability of auxiliary services such as ship maintenance, storage, and trade financing. Evaluating route revenue is essential for merchants, corporations, and administrations seeking to optimize operations and expand their influence within the interstellar network.

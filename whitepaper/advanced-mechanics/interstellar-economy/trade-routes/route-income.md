# Route Income

**Route revenue** represents the amount of Credits generated from interstellar trade between two star systems. This calculation assesses the profitability of a trade connection, determining whether a route is sustainable, lucrative, or operating at a deficit.

Revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including bilateral trade volume, demand for transported goods, starport tariffs, and associated operational costs. High-volume trade routes typically yield greater profits and attract investments in infrastructure, while low-traffic routes may require subsidies or incentives to remain viable.

The economic stability of a route also impacts transport frequency and the availability of auxiliary services, such as ship maintenance, storage, and commercial financing. Evaluating **route revenue** is essential for merchants, corporations, and governing bodies seeking to optimize operations and expand their influence within the interstellar trade network.

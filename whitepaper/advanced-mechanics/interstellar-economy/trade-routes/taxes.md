# Taxes

**Taxes on trade routes** encompass the fees and levies imposed on goods, passengers, and services traveling between star systems. Their purpose is to regulate commerce, generate revenue for local and galactic governments, and, in some cases, shield local economies from external competition.

These taxes may include customs duties, transit fees, and infrastructure usage charges, varying according to each system's regulations. On high-traffic trade routes, tax rates are often standardized, their impact diluted by the sheer volume of commerce. In contrast, peripheral systems or those governed by protectionist policies may impose steep tariffs, restricting access to certain markets.

The application of trade taxes directly affects a route's profitability and can be used strategically to encourage or deter interstellar commerce. Moreover, systems with efficient administration can foster economic stability through balanced tax control, while those burdened by excessive or erratic regulations risk discouraging investment and suppressing trade flows.

# Taxes

Taxes on trade routes represent the fees and duties applied to goods, passengers, and services moving between star systems. Their purpose is to regulate commerce, generate revenue for local and galactic governments, and, in some cases, protect local economies from external competition.

These taxes may include customs duties, transit fees, and infrastructure usage charges, varying according to each systemâ€™s regulations. On high-traffic trade routes, fees are usually standardized, and their impact is diluted by the trade volume. In contrast, peripheral systems or those with protectionist governments may impose high tariffs, limiting access to certain markets.

Tax policies directly influence the profitability of trade routes and can be used strategically to encourage or discourage interstellar commerce. Additionally, systems with efficient administration can generate economic stability through balanced tax control, while those with excessive or chaotic regulations may deter investment and commercial traffic.

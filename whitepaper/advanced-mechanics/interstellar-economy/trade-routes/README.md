# Trade Routes

Trade routes are the backbone of interstellar commerce, determining the flow of goods, passengers, and information between systems. Their efficiency depends on connectivity, traffic frequency, starport infrastructure, security, and local regulations.

Systems well integrated into the trade network maintain dynamic markets, while those in isolated regions face volatility and scarcity. Routes can be divided into long-range trade, operated by megacorporations, and short-range trade, dominated by independent merchants. The security and stability of these routes are influenced by the presence of patrols, piracy, and government restrictions.

Additionally, high-class starports facilitate regular trade with maintenance and storage services, while systems with limited infrastructure make trade riskier. Altogether, trade routes shape the interstellar economy, defining which worlds thrive and which remain on the margins of development.

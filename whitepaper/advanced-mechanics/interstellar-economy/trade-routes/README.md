# Trade Routes

Trade routes are the foundation of interstellar commerce, dictating the flow of goods, passengers, and information between star systems. Their efficiency hinges on connectivity, traffic frequency, starport infrastructure, security, and local regulations.

Systems well integrated into the trade network sustain dynamic markets, while those in isolated regions face volatility and shortages. Trade routes can be divided into long-haul commerce, dominated by megacorporations, and short-range trade, where independent merchants thrive. The security and stability of these routes are shaped by patrol presence, piracy threats, and government-imposed restrictions.

High-class starports support regular trade with maintenance and storage services, while in systems with weaker infrastructure, commerce becomes a far riskier venture. Collectively, trade routes shape the interstellar economy, determining which worlds flourish and which remain on the fringes of development.

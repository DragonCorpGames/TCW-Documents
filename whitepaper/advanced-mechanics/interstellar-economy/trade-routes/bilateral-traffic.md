# Bilateral Traffic

**Bilateral trade volume** measures the flow of commerce between two star systems and is a key factor in determining the viability of a trade route. This calculation estimates the movement of goods, passengers, and data between both points, directly influencing the economic stability of the systems involved.

The significance of bilateral trade lies in its impact on profitability. High trade volumes typically indicate dynamic markets with lucrative opportunities for merchants and corporations, while low-volume routes often rely on subsidies or independent transporters to remain operational. Trade volume also affects starport infrastructure, access to commercial financing, and the presence of customs regulations.

Additionally, security and connectivity play a crucial role. High-traffic routes tend to have stronger protection against piracy and more robust infrastructure, while low-volume routes pose greater investment risks. Ultimately, **bilateral trade volume** serves as a fundamental indicator of a trade routeâ€™s economic relevance and its influence on the development of the connected worlds.

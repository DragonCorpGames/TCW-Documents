# Bilateral Traffic

Bilateral traffic measures the volume of commercial exchange between two star systems and is a key factor in determining a route’s viability. This calculation helps estimate the amount of goods, passengers, and data flowing between both points, which in turn influences the economic stability of the systems involved.

The importance of bilateral traffic lies in its impact on trade profitability. A high volume of traffic typically indicates dynamic markets with opportunities for merchants and corporations, while routes with low exchange tend to rely on subsidies or independent carriers to remain operational. It also affects starport infrastructure, access to trade financing, and the presence of customs regulations.

Additionally, security and connectivity play a crucial role. High-traffic routes are usually better protected against piracy and supported by stronger infrastructure, while low-traffic routes can be riskier for investment. Ultimately, bilateral traffic is a fundamental indicator of a trade route’s economic relevance and its influence on the development of the connected worlds.

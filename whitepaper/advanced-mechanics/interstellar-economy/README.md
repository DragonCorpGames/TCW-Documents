# Interstellar Economy

Across the thousands of inhabited worlds in the galaxy — where countless cultures, ideologies, and species converge — the interstellar economy is a battlefield where only the most cunning corporations manage to thrive.

Despite their diversity, all face the same challenge: the vast distances between star systems. Communication latency creates an information gap that forces corporations to predict price fluctuations, invest cautiously, and build resilient logistical networks.

In this uncertain environment, decisions are made with outdated data, creating a highly speculative and strategic market where foresight and ingenuity determine who prospers and who crumbles in the vastness of space. In this economic struggle, information is both a commodity and a weapon — and controlling it can mean the difference between dominance and oblivion.

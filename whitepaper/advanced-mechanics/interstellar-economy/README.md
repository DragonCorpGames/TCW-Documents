# Interstellar Economy

Across the thousands of inhabited worlds of the galaxy, where countless cultures, ideologies, and species converge, the interstellar economy is a battlefield where only the most cunning corporations manage to thrive.

Despite their diversity, they all face the same relentless challenge: the vast distances between star systems. The latency in communications creates an information gap, forcing them to predict price fluctuations, invest wisely, and build resilient logistical networks.

In this uncertain environment, decisions are made with outdated data, shaping a highly speculative and strategic market where foresight and ingenuity determine who prospers and who crumbles into the void. But in this economic struggle, information is both a commodity and a weapon, and its control can mean the difference between dominance and oblivion.

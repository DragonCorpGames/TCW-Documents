# Insurance and Coverage

In a decentralized market with outdated information, insurance and financial coverage are essential for mitigating the risks caused by informational latency and interstellar volatility. Insurers operate in an environment of uncertainty, where claims assessments and policy settlements may rely on obsolete or delayed data due to the cyclical nature of interplanetary trade.

Certain coverage plans protect against losses stemming from abrupt asset value fluctuations, delays in financial data delivery, or economic crises triggered by informational discrepancies. Others are designed to mitigate risks in cargo transportation, ensuring compensation in cases of pirate attacks, trade route failures, or sudden shifts in market conditions.

These financial instruments are structured to ensure the operational continuity of businesses and corporations in peripheral or low-connectivity systems, where unforeseen events are harder to manage.

Regulatory bodies attempt to establish stability through audits and mandatory coverage clauses for high-value transactions. However, the decentralization of the financial system leaves many regions beyond their reach, fostering a parallel market of speculative insurance and high-risk private contracts.

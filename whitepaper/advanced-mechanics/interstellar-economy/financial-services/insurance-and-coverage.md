# Insurance and Coverage

In a decentralized market with outdated information, insurance and financial coverage are essential for mitigating risks caused by information latency and interstellar volatility. Insurance companies operate in an environment of uncertainty, where claim assessments and policy settlements may rely on outdated or delayed information due to interplanetary trade cycles.

There are coverage options that protect against losses from sudden asset value fluctuations, delays in the delivery of financial information, or economic crises triggered by informational mismatches. Others are designed to mitigate risks during cargo transport, guaranteeing compensation in cases of pirate attacks, trade route failures, or unexpected changes in market conditions.

These products are structured to ensure operational continuity for businesses and corporations in peripheral or low-connectivity systems, where unforeseen events are harder to manage.

Regulatory agencies attempt to establish stability frameworks through audits and mandatory coverage clauses for high-value transactions. However, the decentralization of the financial system leaves many regions beyond their reach, fostering a parallel market of speculative insurance and high-risk private contracts.

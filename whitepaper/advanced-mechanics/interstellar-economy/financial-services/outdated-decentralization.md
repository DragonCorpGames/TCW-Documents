# Outdated Decentralization

In an environment where information is only current within the star system where it resides, decentralization is not a strategy but a consequence of technological limitations. News, economic data, and political decisions travel alongside commerce — at the speed of the ships carrying interstellar mail. As a result, each system operates with outdated knowledge about the others, depending entirely on the frequency and speed of trade routes.

This information delay can cause overlaps and contradictions, with faster ships delivering recent updates while others transport already obsolete reports. Heavily trafficked systems enjoy better information flow, while frontier regions remain in a constant state of uncertainty.

The consequences are profound: markets fluctuate without warning, conflicts ignite based on outdated data, and manipulation opportunities arise for those who control the flow of information. Outdated decentralization turns knowledge into a volatile and strategic resource, where time and logistics determine which version of the truth prevails in each corner of space.

This phenomenon directly impacts financial services, where outdated information makes every transaction a gamble on events that have already occurred — but are not yet known. Institutions must operate in an environment of constant uncertainty, establishing networks of cross-deposits and dynamic guarantees to mitigate risk. The most active trade routes become centers of financial stability, while peripheral markets face extreme volatility — where speculation and manipulation can redefine entire fortunes with the arrival of a single ship carrying fresh data.

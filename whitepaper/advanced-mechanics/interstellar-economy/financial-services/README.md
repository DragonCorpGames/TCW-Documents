# Financial Services

The interstellar financial system is a decentralized network of banks, investment funds, and credit operators competing for control of capital in an interplanetary economy where information and assets must move along trade routes. The lack of instant communication has led to the creation of complex structures of cross-deposits, clearing funds, and securitized transfers that ensure liquidity and stability.

Major corporations use credit as a tool for expansion and dominance, accessing interplanetary credit lines, strategic bonds, and financing backed by tangible assets such as manufacturing, trade routes, or natural resources. At the same time, the financial market is a battlefield where speculative attacks, currency manipulation, and collateral collapses can trigger controlled economic crises or strategic sabotage.

Although galactic powers attempt to enforce regulations, decentralization favors corruption, enabling the existence of orbital tax havens, proxy banks, and monetary manipulation capable of destabilizing entire economies. In this universe, finance is not just a means of exchange but a weapon of control and power â€” used both for economic expansion and covert warfare between corporations and governments.

The financial system of **The Corporate Wars** is not merely a reflection of interstellar trade but a strategic arena where the true power struggles of the galaxy are decided.

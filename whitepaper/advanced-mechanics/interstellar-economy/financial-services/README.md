# Financial Services

The interstellar financial system is a decentralized network of banks, investment funds, and credit operators competing for control of capital in an interplanetary economy where information and assets must travel along trade routes. The absence of instant communication has given rise to complex structures of cross-deposits, compensation funds, and securitized transfers, ensuring liquidity and stability across vast distances.

Major corporations wield credit as both a tool of expansion and a weapon of domination, leveraging interplanetary credit lines, strategic bonds, and asset-backed financing tied to industries, trade routes, or natural resources. At the same time, the financial market itself is a battlefield, where speculative attacks, currency manipulations, and collateral collapses can trigger controlled economic crises or serve as strategic sabotage.

While galactic powers attempt to impose regulations, decentralization fuels corruption, enabling the existence of orbital tax havens, proxy banks, and monetary manipulations capable of destabilizing entire economies. In this universe, finance is not merely a medium of exchange—it is a weapon of control and power, wielded for both economic expansion and covert warfare between corporations and governments.

The financial system of _The Corporate Wars_ is more than a reflection of interstellar trade—it is a strategic arena where the true battles for power in the galaxy are fought.

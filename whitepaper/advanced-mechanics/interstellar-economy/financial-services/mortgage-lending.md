# Mortgage Lending

In a financial system decentralized by informational latency, mortgage lending operates under constant uncertainty. The lack of up-to-date data forces banks to diversify collateral, blending physical assets with commercial rights and cross-deposit guarantees. Property valuations are fluid, recalibrating whenever trade routes deliver fresh information, sometimes triggering abrupt adjustments to loan terms.

Interest rates fluctuate based on a star system’s connectivity—stable along densely traveled routes, volatile in isolated regions. To mitigate risk, mortgages often include renegotiation clauses or mobile collateral. In this environment, informational speculation allows certain players to capitalize on revaluations before the broader market can react, solidifying mortgage credit as both a financial instrument and a tool of interstellar economic control.

# Mortgage Lending

In a financial system decentralized by information latency, mortgage loans operate under constant uncertainty. The lack of up-to-date data forces banks to diversify collateral, combining physical assets with commercial rights and cross-deposits. Property appraisals are dynamic, adjusting whenever trade routes bring in new information — often triggering abrupt recalculations of loan terms.

Interest rates fluctuate based on a star system’s connectivity — remaining more stable along heavily trafficked routes and highly volatile in isolated regions. To mitigate risks, mortgages may include renegotiation clauses or mobile collateral. In this environment, informational speculation allows certain actors to capitalize on revaluations before the broader market reacts, turning mortgage credit into both a financing tool and a means of interstellar economic control.

# Stocks and Shares

The stock and securities market in a decentralized environment operates with fragmented and delayed information, introducing a high degree of speculation and volatility. Trade routes dictate the frequency at which financial data reaches each system, causing sharp fluctuations in asset values. Financial operators exploit these discrepancies, securing profits before information synchronizes across star systems.

Interstellar financial market regulators include institutional oversight entities that attempt to mitigate the effects of informational latency through systematic audits, capital flow controls, and market regulations in the most connected systems. However, their ability to intervene is limited in peripheral zones, where financial decentralization enables aggressive speculative practicesâ€”ranging from price manipulation to insider trading before valuations update in other systems.

In this landscape, control over information channels is a critical factor, granting certain players the ability to influence entire markets before official data reaches its destinations.

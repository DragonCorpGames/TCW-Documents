# Stocks and Shares

The stocks and securities market in a decentralized environment operates with fragmented and delayed information, introducing a high degree of speculation and volatility. Trade routes determine how often financial data reaches each system, causing abrupt fluctuations in asset values. Financial operators exploit these discrepancies to gain profits before information synchronizes between star systems.

Interstellar financial market regulators include institutional oversight entities that attempt to mitigate the effects of information latency through systematic audits, capital flow controls, and market regulation in the most connected systems. However, their ability to intervene is limited in peripheral zones, where financial decentralization allows aggressive speculative practices â€” from price manipulation to insider trading before asset values update in other systems.

In this context, control over information channels becomes a critical factor, granting certain actors the ability to influence entire markets before official data reaches its destination.

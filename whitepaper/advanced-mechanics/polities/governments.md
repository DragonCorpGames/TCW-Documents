# Governments

In **The Corporate Wars**, governments represent the Polities with sovereign authority over territories, populations, and resources. Their structure and scope vary from small planetary states to vast interstellar empires that control entire sectors of the galaxy. Each exercises its power through systems of laws, armed forces, and bureaucracies dedicated to maintaining order and managing their domains. The diversity of government forms reflects the historical and cultural circumstances of each world or coalition, ranging from hereditary monarchies to functional republics or military dictatorships.

These political and cultural differences directly influence trade and foreign relations. Some governments promote open markets, applying low tariffs and encouraging the free flow of goods and capital, while others protect themselves behind rigid customs regulations and state monopolies. On certain worlds, the law is flexible and favorable to foreign investments; on others, xenophobia or cultural isolation makes any dealings with outsiders difficult. These conditions define the risks and opportunities of operating within each jurisdiction, turning navigation through known space into a constant game of diplomacy, adaptation, and strategy.

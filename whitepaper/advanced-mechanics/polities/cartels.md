# Cartels

Large-scale corporate alliances formed by multiple companies, guilds, or consortiums that cooperate under agreements of common interest are known as **Cartels**. These entities control key sectors of the interstellar economy, such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, or the trade of strategic resources. Far from merely being conglomerates, cartels are structured as true Polities with the power to regulate their own markets and exert influence over entire governments and colonies.

The operation of a cartel is based on the coordination of prices, the allocation of trade routes and concessions, and the protection of its interests from external rivals or internal dissent. While their methods can be aggressive, their power lies in the ability to sustain networks of influence that transcend the borders of any government or institution, making them fundamental players in the economy and politics of **The Corporate Wars**.

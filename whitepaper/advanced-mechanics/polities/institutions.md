# Institutions

Institutions represent specialized power structures that operate on an interplanetary or interstellar scale, regulating fundamental aspects of trade, navigation, and coexistence between Polities. These entities act as arbitrators, overseers, or guarantors of treaties and regulations that facilitate interaction in an environment where distances and cultural differences would make coordination impossible without a common framework.

Examples of these institutions include the **Starport Authority**, responsible for standardizing and overseeing interstellar trade and transit hubs, or **Banking Consortiums**, which ensure the stability of transactions and compliance with large-scale contracts. While they do not directly govern territories, their influence can be decisive in the fate of worlds and corporations by granting licenses, imposing sanctions, or limiting access to strategic markets.

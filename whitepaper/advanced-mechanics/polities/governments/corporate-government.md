# Corporate Government

Among the forms of government in the galaxy, the **Corporate Government** stands out, where administration and political power are directly in the hands of a corporation or business consortium. In this model, the board of directors or shareholders replace traditional governing bodies, and decisions are made based on profit and commercial expansion logic. These entities govern worlds and colonies as extensions of their assets, regulating the lives of their inhabitants under internal rules where citizenship and property are subordinated to the corporation's interests.

For players, understanding how a Corporate Government operates is essential, as these worlds function under their own rules and priorities. Local laws may protect the company's assets above any individual rights, and disputes are resolved in internal courts where only contracts and shares matter. In these environments, commercial opportunities are vast, but so are the risks: every operation is conducted under the direct surveillance of the government-corporation, and any mistake can cost ownership, freedom, or even life.

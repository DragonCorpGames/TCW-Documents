# Polities

In **The Corporate Wars**, the term "Polities" refers to the power and governance entities that exist and operate within known space. These structures define the balance of power, operating rights, and legal limitations in each star system or trade route, establishing the foundations upon which relationships between worlds, corporations, and institutions are built.

A Polity can range from star empires governing vast territories to independent planetary states, regional coalitions, corporations with sovereign authority, and interstellar guilds. Each has its own system of laws, institutions, and forces that allow it to exercise control over its domains, regulate trade, and protect its interests against other powers. The technological, cultural, and economic diversity of each Polity reflects its unique history and its degree of integration with the interstellar community.

The interaction between these entities is constant and shaped by treaties, territorial disputes, trade agreements, and historical rivalries. The borders of each Polity are not always clear or permanent, and its influence can extend beyond its official boundaries, affecting the development of routes, markets, and entire colonies in the endless scenario of interstellar expansion and competition.

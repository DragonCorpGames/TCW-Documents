# Banking

The interstellar banking sector stands at the pinnacle of economic power in _The Corporate Wars_. It is not merely about managing capital but about controlling the flow of wealth across entire systems and sectors. Securing authorization to operate in this field is no simple task—banking is heavily regulated by local authorities, interstellar alliances, and financial markets, all of which impose strict requirements to prevent monopolistic abuses, economic collapses, or capital movements that could destabilize entire regions.

Interstellar banking goes far beyond simple accounts and loans. Institutions capable of financing megacorporations, managing transgalactic investments, and backing credit across multiple systems wield an influence comparable to that of governments. However, achieving this level of power requires extraordinary financial solvency, access to vast reserves, and the ability to navigate multiple regulatory frameworks without incurring sanctions or economic isolation.

Not all corporations have equal access to the banking sector. While some companies may offer limited financial services within their own networks, operating at an interstellar scale demands extreme capitalization, recognition by major financial institutions, and entry into highly regulated markets. In many cases, barriers to entry are not just government-imposed—they are deliberately maintained by existing banking powers seeking to eliminate competition and retain control over credit markets and investment flows.

For corporations that successfully break into this sector, the opportunities are immense. From issuing loans to governments and businesses to managing insurance and financial markets, banking does not merely generate wealth—it defines it. Ultimately, controlling capital is more than just financing operations—it is shaping the fate of economies, dictating the future of entire systems, and exerting power without ever needing to resort to force.

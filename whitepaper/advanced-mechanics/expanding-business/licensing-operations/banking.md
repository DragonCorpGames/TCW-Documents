# Banking

The interstellar banking sector represents the pinnacle of economic power in **The Corporate Wars**. It is not just about managing capital; it is about controlling the flow of wealth across entire systems and sectors. Obtaining permits to operate in this field is no easy task: banking is regulated by local entities, interstellar alliances, and financial markets that impose strict requirements to prevent abusive monopolies, economic collapses, or capital movements that could destabilize entire regions.

Interstellar banking goes beyond simple accounts and loans. Institutions capable of offering financing to megacorporations, managing transgalactic investments, and guaranteeing credit backing across multiple systems can wield influence comparable to that of governments. However, to reach this level, a financial entity must demonstrate extraordinary solvency, access to massive reserves, and the ability to operate within multiple regulatory frameworks without incurring sanctions or blockages.

Access to the banking sector is not equal for all corporations. While some companies may offer limited financial services within their own network, the ability to operate on an interstellar scale requires extreme capitalization, recognition from major economic institutions, and access to regulated markets. In many cases, entry barriers are not only imposed by governments but by the banking entities themselves, seeking to avoid competition and preserve their dominance over credit and financing markets.

For corporations that manage to establish themselves in this sector, the opportunities are immense. From granting loans to governments and companies to managing insurance and securities markets, banking does not just generate wealth â€” it defines it. Ultimately, controlling capital not only allows corporations to finance their own operations but also to influence the direction of entire economies, shaping the destiny of systems and sectors without resorting to force.

# Starport Authority

In **The Corporate Wars**, the management of a starport is typically a governmental responsibility or falls under the jurisdiction of an interstellar regulatory institution, ensuring compliance with traffic, security, and trade regulations. However, corporations can obtain permits to operate parallel private infrastructures within or near a starport, consolidating their presence in interstellar trade without having to take full control of the main facility.

Corporate ports function as private terminals, offering specialized services to affiliated clients and fleets without relying on the system's public administration. These facilities may include loading and unloading platforms, exclusive hangars, storage areas, and supply centers, allowing the corporation to optimize its operations without external interference. Obtaining permits to build and operate these structures requires compliance with local regulations and agreements with the official port authority, with terms that vary based on the level of governmental control and the influence of interstellar entities in the region.

Although most starports are government-managed, there are exceptional cases where a corporation manages to take full control of a space transit facility. This can occur in systems with highly privatized economies, in regions where a company has financed and built the entire port infrastructure, or in territories with no clear central authority, where the corporation becomes the only entity with the logistical capability to manage space traffic.

Regardless of the level of control acquired, operating in the port sector is a strategic step for any corporation with expansion ambitions. Having proprietary infrastructure within or alongside a starport allows for cost reductions, improves efficiency in the transit of goods, and establishes a closed logistics network that ensures the security and exclusivity of operations. In an environment where access to galactic markets defines corporate success, controlling the flow of goods and people within a port, even partially, provides a significant advantage in the competition for commercial supremacy.

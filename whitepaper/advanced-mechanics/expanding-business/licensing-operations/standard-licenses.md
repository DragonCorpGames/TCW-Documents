# Standard Licenses

Standard licenses in **The Corporate Wars** are basic authorizations that allow a corporation to operate within its initial framework and easily expand into common activities within the market. From its foundation, each company is granted a license that provides access to certain sectors, and as long as its operations remain within these boundaries, obtaining new permits is a simple and automatic process.

These permits cover activities deemed essential for trade and production, including those that, while not part of a corporationâ€™s core initial operations, are common enough not to require additional approvals or excessive paperwork. As long as the established requirements are met, authorizations are granted without regulatory obstacles or the need for prolonged negotiations.

However, not all operations fall into this category. Strategic sectors require more complex approval processes and are subject to stricter controls. Similarly, activities that fall outside the legal framework of a star system are not authorized, but are considered illegal, placing corporations that engage in them on a terrain where regulation ceases to be a bureaucratic issue and becomes a matter of survival.

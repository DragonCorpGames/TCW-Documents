# Standard Licenses

Standard permits in _The Corporate Wars_ are basic authorizations that allow a corporation to operate within its initial framework and expand easily into common market activities. From the moment of its founding, every company is issued a license granting access to specific sectors, and as long as operations remain within these limits, obtaining additional permits is a simple and automatic process.

These permits cover activities deemed essential to trade and production, including those that, while not part of a corporation’s core focus, are common enough not to require excessive approvals or regulatory delays. As long as established requirements are met, authorizations are granted without obstacles, negotiations, or lengthy bureaucratic procedures.

However, not all operations fall under this category. Strategic sectors require more complex approval processes and are subject to tighter oversight. Likewise, activities that fall outside the legal framework of a star system are not merely unlicensed—they are classified as crimes. Corporations operating in these gray areas do not face regulatory hurdles but survival challenges, where the line between legality and raw power becomes the only true rule of law.

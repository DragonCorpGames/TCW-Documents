# Game-driven polities

In **The Corporate Wars**, the universe operates on a set of structural and economic policies directly governed by the system, designed to maintain balance and coherence throughout the ecosystem. These policies are not subject to player voting or corporate control but are part of the immutable global mechanics that govern the economy, resource flow, and the basic rules of interaction within the persistent universe.

Within this framework, the game regulates aspects such as interplanetary fee calculation algorithms, global operational costs, network and transaction fees, and the market balance between supply and demand of key resources. The purpose of these policies is to ensure that the interstellar economy remains functional, preventing scenarios of collapse or hyperinflation caused by excessive player intervention. These rules apply uniformly across the universe and are enforced through automatic auditing and balancing systems, operating as the economic backbone that guarantees the persistence and coherence of the system.

While players compete for control of territories, routes, and local governments, the **Game-Directed Policies** set the global limits and conditions under which that competition unfolds. These mechanics determine, for example, how much it truly costs to traverse an interstellar route, the cost of maintaining a fleet, or how fees are distributed in transactions. Ultimately, this layer of systemic governance acts as an invisible but relentless regulator, ensuring that the universe of **The Corporate Wars** functions as a living, complex, and self-regulating economy.

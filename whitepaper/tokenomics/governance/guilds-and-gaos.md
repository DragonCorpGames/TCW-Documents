# Guilds and GAOs

**Guilds** and **GAOs (Autonomous Governance Organizations)** represent the most advanced and structured form of organization within **The Corporate Wars**. These entities are created, controlled, and financed by players and corporations, functioning as true political and economic powers within the persistent universe. Unlike individual entities, guilds and GAOs not only manage assets and territories but also actively participate in dynamic governance, having a say in decisions that affect the balance of entire sectors of the galaxy.

Their power is built upon the accumulation of capital, ownership of strategic assets, and the ability to mobilize resources and specialized personnel on a large scale. These organizations can control trade routes, star systems, starports, and even participate in the regulation of local markets, imposing tariffs, managing banking services, or dictating exploitation conditions in their areas of influence. As they grow, guilds and GAOs cease to be mere player collectives and become autonomous power centers, capable of competing for control with the gameâ€™s AI or other entities.

In this system, local and sectorial governance is not just a right but a responsibility: **GAOs** can establish regulations, sign macroeconomic contracts, and condition the operations of other players within their territory. Their active participation in governance structures ensures that the politics and economy of the game remain alive, complex, and in constant evolution, where real power is measured by the ability to influence the environment and the rules that govern the galactic economy.

# Governance

**Governance** in **The Corporate Wars** is the system that articulates and enforces the economic rules within the persistent universe. Designed as a dynamic and decentralized structure, it allows players, corporations, and guilds to actively participate in decision-making that affects both economic development and political control of strategic territories. Through tokenized structures and mechanisms such as staking and voting, governance regulates key aspects such as local regulations, resource allocation, and the establishment of rights over trade routes and assets.

The system is divided into two major levels: on one hand, the immutable rules — the economic balance, base mechanics, and operational principles — form part of the game’s structural design and ensure the coherence and stability of the ecosystem. On the other hand, there is a set of dynamic mechanisms that players can directly influence. This is where local bodies and sector authorities come into play, which can be managed by both players and the system’s AI, acting as another actor — shrewd and ruthless — in defense of its own interests.

The macro-level scenario is regulated by global governance contracts, structures that apply audits, fees, and power balances on a large scale, ensuring the overall functioning of the economic network. In parallel, the micro-level scenario is where the real friction occurs: corporations, starport authorities, banks, and local governments — whether players or the AI itself — enforce regulations, tariffs, and restrictions that shape the daily operations. Interaction with these entities defines the real game, where it is not always clear who you will end up paying fees, tolls, or favors to in order to make your empire thrive. In **The Corporate Wars**, governance is not just a system of rules: it is the battlefield where the economic war for control of the galaxy is fought.

# Asset Packages

**Asset Packages** in **The Corporate Wars** are designed as strategic combinations of **SPL tokens**, **NFTs** of facilities, ships, industrial designs, and exclusive contracts that allow players to start their activity within the universe with a solid infrastructure and clear competitive advantages. These packages represent complete economic blocks ready for operation, providing access to scarce resources, priority routes, or rights to strategic enclaves.

Beyond the initial launch offerings, **Asset Packages** are part of the core mechanics of the game and can even be granted within the **free-to-play** model, under a credit and guarantee system. In this case, the assets provided serve as collateral for an operational loan: the player can exploit their economic potential but assumes the responsibility of repaying the value of the package through in-game activity. In case of default, the assets may be seized and returned to the market, thus ensuring the sustainability of the system and the balance of the living economy. This design offers every player the opportunity to scale and prosper while maintaining economic control that is firm and consistent with the gameâ€™s vision.

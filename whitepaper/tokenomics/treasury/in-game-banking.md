# In-Game Banking

The **interstellar banking** system of **The Corporate Wars** is the operational financial engine of the Treasury and the system responsible for maintaining the flow of **MCr** capital within the persistent universe. Its main function is to facilitate access to credit and investment, allowing players and corporations to expand their operational capacity without requiring immediate liquidity. Banking operates exclusively in **MCr**, managing loans, lines of credit, and financial products backed by tokenized assets — **NFTs**, rights, concessions, and infrastructure — which act as guarantees for each operation.

Each loan granted by the bank is not a simple transfer of funds, but a temporary and controlled issuance of **MCr**, directly recorded in the internal balance sheet of the system. These "issued" **MCr** remain locked in the in-game economy, solely designated for productive operations, with no possibility of leaving the market until amortization conditions are met. This dynamic generates internal liquidity to sustain economic growth, while preserving the scarcity and value of **MCr** in external circulation.

The bank also operates as an economic adjustment mechanism, controlling the rate of credit expansion and absorbing excess capital through interest and refinancing. Part of the interest generated from credit operations is reinvested as rewards for active players, while another portion is allocated to cover operational costs and maintain the Treasury’s stability. In this design, the bank does not manage direct **RU** flows, but its activities indirectly influence the macroeconomy: by facilitating investments in infrastructure and system exploitation, it amplifies or restricts access to the **RUs** stored in worlds, thereby impacting trade route dynamics and the strategic value of each region.

This system makes banking the axis of the game’s economic expansion and balance, where every financial decision, loan, and investment is part of a real and measurable economic cycle. Credit is not just a tool for growth, but also a commitment that binds corporations and players to the system, where profitability and survival depend on their ability to manage debt, capital, and risk in a constantly competitive environment.

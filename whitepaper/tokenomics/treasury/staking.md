# Staking and Vesting

In **The Corporate Wars**, the vesting system is inherent to the game's economic structure and acts as the mechanism that regulates the release and access to **MCr** capital. Every operation within the persistent universe — from contracts and missions to investments in infrastructure or trade routes — is explicitly or abstractly subject to vesting processes. This means that committed capital, whether in the form of rewards, future benefits, or profitability on assets, is not released immediately but is tied to the fulfillment of economic conditions, debt amortization, or the completion of productive cycles.

This design ensures that liquidity flows in a controlled manner and prevents imbalances in the **MCr** supply, protecting the value of the token in the market. As players develop their operations, capital remains temporarily locked within the economic system, only being released when objectives are completed or agreed conditions are met. Thus, vesting becomes the fundamental mechanic that anchors economic growth to real performance, generating a sustainable value cycle directly tied to in-game activity.

In parallel, **staking** serves as the foundation for the treasury and banking system. Players and entities can lock **MCr** in staking to provide liquidity, sustain the financial network, and back credit operations and economic expansion. This immobilized capital reinforces the system's solvency, enabling the bank to issue loans and lines of credit without compromising the stability of the token. In return, participants in staking receive returns proportional to their commitment and the success of the ecosystem, feeding a rewards cycle directly linked to the growth and financial health of **The Corporate Wars**.

This balance between vesting and staking transforms the game’s economy into a robust and self-regulating system, where capital only circulates based on the assumed risk, active participation, and achievement of objectives, reflecting the best economic design practices in next-generation blockchain ecosystems on Solana.

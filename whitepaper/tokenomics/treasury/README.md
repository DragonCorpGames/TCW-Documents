# Treasury

The **Treasury** of **The Corporate Wars** is the financial and regulatory core of the economic ecosystem, designed to maintain system stability and ensure the balance between the real value of **MCr** and the economic activity generated within the persistent universe. Its function goes beyond simple fund custody: it acts as a central bank, credit regulator, and liquidity guarantor, ensuring that every **MCr** in circulation is backed by real activity and controlled capital.

The **MCr** does not behave like an infinitely issued token or a mere currency for passing transactions. Its value is sustained by scarcity induced by design: the capital available in the market is conditioned by internal flows of debt, amortization, and guarantees. As players invest, take out credit, or expand operations, the **MCr** circulates and is locked within the economic system, fueling activity without causing an oversupply in the external market. In this way, the more intense the in-game economic activity — infrastructure construction, route exploitation, operation financing — the greater the volume of **MCr** trapped in the internal cycle, and the scarcer and more valuable the token becomes in circulation outside the game.

Each micro-investment by players — whether in facilities, ships, personnel, or route upgrades — is not a mere expense but a direct investment in the **Resource Units (RUs)** network. These actions impact the wealth extraction and conversion capacity of worlds and trade routes, activating new flows and generating future profitability. The Treasury turns this economic movement into a cycle of value: the interest generated by banking, staking, and vesting feeds back into the system, becoming rewards, while the net profits cover the operational costs of the project — infrastructure, development, security, network fees, and ecosystem maintenance — ensuring the sustainability and expansion of the universe without relying on artificial emissions.

This design makes the **Treasury** the ultimate guarantee of value and balance, capable of sustaining a real economy within a virtual environment, where every investment decision, every credit cycle, and every executed contract affects the global value of the system. The **MCr** that reaches the external market is backed not only by SOL or BTC reserves but by the very economic activity and network of tokenized assets that support it. The more the network grows and the greater the interaction between players, the more the **Treasury**'s capacity to generate value and ensure a stable, solid, and sustainable economic cycle in the long term is reinforced.

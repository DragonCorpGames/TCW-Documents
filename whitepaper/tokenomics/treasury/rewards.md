# Rewards

The **Treasury** of **The Corporate Wars** not only distributes **MCr** as a reward but also integrates a comprehensive value return system on the capital in play. Players and corporations participating in credits or staking receive a dynamically calculated percentage of return based on global economic activity, the volume of immobilized capital, and the profitability of interstellar banking operations. This system allows participants to earn real benefits for their commitment to the stability and growth of the economic network, rewarding both active investment and efficient resource management.

In addition to **MCr**, rewards may include unique or strategic **NFTs**, ranging from rights to facilities to preferential access to trade routes or high-value assets within the game. These rewards are not just cosmetic; they represent real ownership of key elements within the galactic economy, opening new opportunities for investment, exploitation, and territorial control for players who manage to stand out in the economic competition.

The entire reward and transaction system is designed to be free of direct commissions for the player. Microtransactions, network costs, and blockchain batching operations are absorbed by the Treasury as part of the operational cost, financed by the net profits of the ecosystem. Even fuel consumption — calculated based on distance, cargo, and route conditions — is seamlessly integrated into the economic system through the automatic conversion of Fuel to **MCr** and **MCr** to **Lamports** in each transaction, ensuring a smooth, frictionless experience fully focused on the player as both a customer and investor within a real and sustainable economic universe.

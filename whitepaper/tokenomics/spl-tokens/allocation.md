# Allocation

The initial token allocation in **The Corporate Wars** lays the foundation for the interstellar economy and ensures the ecosystem's stability from the moment of launch. The model involves two primary assets: the **MegaCredit (MCr)** as the market currency and financial unit, and the **Resource Units (RUs)** as the macroeconomic representation of the productive value of each star system.

For the **MCr**, there is no predetermined total issuance. The circulation of this currency is dynamically adjusted based on real economic activity, supported by the treasury and liquidity funds in external assets. For the launch, an initial supply of **MCr** will be made available to ensure market liquidity, activate staking and vesting, and involve strategic entities like **Dragon Corp.**, guilds, and collaborating game guilds. The rest of the system relies on locked reserves and control mechanisms that regulate the issuance and absorption of capital according to the internal economic cycle, ensuring scarcity and backing for the **MCr** available in the external market.

**RUs**, by their nature, are allocated as a fixed and limited volume from the start. A portion is distributed among the known and accessible worlds and trade routes, while another is reserved for the unexplored regions of the galaxy, waiting to be unlocked through the expansion and progress of players. This stock of **RUs** is neither created nor destroyed: it flows and redistributes based on economic activity, investments in infrastructure, and strategic decisions made by players. The **RUs** economy is a direct reflection of the growth and exploitation of systems, where each action impacts the balance of trade routes and the value of worlds within the interstellar commercial network.

The distribution policy ensures that only net benefits generated within the game — derived from activity, banking interest, and rewards — can be released to the market. This means that the greater the economic activity and the use of credit in the game universe, the higher the generation of rewards and the burning of **MCr**, reinforcing the value of the circulating token. In this way, the structure ensures that the **MCr** reaching the external market is always backed and controlled, preserving scarcity and protecting value for all participants.

# Resource Units \[RUs]

**Resource Units (RUs)** represent the macroeconomic expression of the productive value of each star system, colony, or trade route within **The Corporate Wars**. They function as a tokenized financial asset that measures the wealth-generating capacity of a world and its integration into the interstellar economic network. Beyond physical resources, **RUs** encapsulate the economic potential of productive, industrial, and commercial sectors, serving as an indicator of the balance between supply and demand that defines large-scale trade flow.

Their behavior is essentially self-adjusting under conditions of equilibrium: the inflows and outflows of **RUs** from a system naturally tend to balance, keeping the economic value of each world stable. Only direct intervention, whether through successful exploitation of new resources or collapses in trade routes and markets, can disrupt this balance and cause the revaluation or depreciation of a system. Worlds store **RUs** as an economic reserve, starports act as conversion and balancing nodes between **RUs** and **MCr**, and trade routes reflect in real-time the flow and economic health of the regions. In this model, managing and altering the balance of **RUs** is one of the most direct ways to intervene in the real value of a world or an entire star network.

# Other Currencies

In addition to the large interstellar capital flows, each world, colony, or jurisdiction maintains its own local currencies, reflecting its economic sovereignty and financial culture. These currencies, used in everyday trade and internal operations, have no recognition beyond their borders and lack value in the interplanetary circuit. Their tax systems, regulations, and volatility are part of the local landscape, and for external agents, they represent more of an operational complexity than a real source of wealth. Still, understanding and navigating these economies is essential for those seeking to operate successfully on the surface of each world.

Alongside these local currencies, the universe of **The Corporate Wars** also includes the existence of bonds, securities, and private currencies in interstellar circulation, issued by large consortia, guilds, or interplanetary banks. These instruments, often tokenized, function as financial utilities within certain sectors or specific trade routes, facilitating transactions, guaranteeing contracts, or supporting strategic investments. While their acceptance is limited and their value can fluctuate depending on the context, their proper use offers key tactical advantages in complex operations that exceed the reach of traditional planetary currencies.

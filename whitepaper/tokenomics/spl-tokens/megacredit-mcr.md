# MegaCredit \[MCr]

The **MegaCredit (MCr)** is the standard currency of the game and the primary **SPL token** that underpins the entire interstellar economy of **The Corporate Wars**. More than just a unit of exchange, the **MCr** serves as the absolute reference for contracts, loans, guarantees, and settlements within the persistent universe. It is the foundation upon which financial and commercial operations are built, from large auctions and interstellar banking to everyday trade between players and corporations. Its design as a stable currency ensures consistency in value and predictability in transactions, protecting the internal economy from external volatility.

The issuance and circulation of the **MCr** are regulated by an economic control system that carefully manages its minting, burning, and availability. While the internal flow sustains commercial and strategic activity, the extraction of **MCr** to the external market is strictly limited to free capital, once obligations, guarantees, and pending amortizations are deducted. This approach helps maintain monetary stability and control inflation, ensuring that the value of the **MCr**, both within and outside the game, is always supported by real economic activity and liquidity funds intended to sustain the systemâ€™s balance.

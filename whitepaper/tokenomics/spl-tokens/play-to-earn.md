# Play to Earn

The **Play to Earn (P2E)** model of **The Corporate Wars** is built on the **MCr** as the reference currency, both in-game and on-chain, where each credit holds real weight in the global economy of the game. Players generate income by controlling assets, operating trade routes, or completing contracts and missions that directly impact the economic network. However, making profits is not immediate or guaranteed: the circulating capital is conditioned by debts, obligations, and guarantees that each player must manage to access the real benefits of their operations.

Every investment — a ship, a facility, or even a contract — typically comes with pending credits and amortizations that must be covered before benefits can be withdrawn. In this scenario, it is common for a player to find themselves trapped in debt cycles, refinancing their assets or covering payments with new operations while the banking system controls and oversees their economic flow. Only those with sufficient guarantee funds, whether through staking, vesting, or accumulated liquidity, can break that cycle and transform their economic growth into free capital. The reward comes, but only after proving management ability and financial balance in an environment designed to simulate the harshness of a real interstellar economy.

This system turns credit into a tool of progress and risk, where the bank itself acts as both a generator of value and an arbiter of the economic game. The interest accrued on active credits doesn’t disappear: a portion is used to burn debt and maintain monetary balance, while another portion is preserved as a reward fund for those who manage to master the system. Thus, **The Corporate Wars** offers an experience where asset control, debt management, and calculated risk-taking are as important as any military or commercial strategy, and where every financial decision leaves an imprint on a tokenized economy backed by real value on Solana.

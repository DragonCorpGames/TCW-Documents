# In-Game P2E

**The Corporate Wars** is a tactical and economic MMORTS set in a distant future, where interstellar communications depend on the physical transit of ships and cargo through trade routes. In this scenario, players take on the role of expanding megacorporations, competing for control over resources, systems, and markets in a galactic network of interconnected economies. Efficient asset management, exploitation of trade routes, and strategic decision-making are key to succeeding in an environment where each world presents unique risks and opportunities based on its level of economic integration.

The game's economy is built on a fully tokenized **Play to Earn (P2E)** system integrated into the **Solana blockchain**, designed to functionally and coherently replicate the complexity of an interstellar macroeconomy. Assets — from personnel and resources to facilities and ships — are represented as **SPL Tokens** and **NFTs** with traceability and real ownership, allowing players to participate in a persistent economy where each action has a direct impact on the game universe.

The **MegaCredit (MCr)** is the standard currency of this system, backed by locked assets and used in financial contracts, interstellar banking, and large-scale trade. Its issuance and circulation are controlled by the game’s treasury and banking system, ensuring economic stability and balance at all times. Meanwhile, **Resource Units (RUs)** represent the macroeconomic value stored in worlds and trade routes, reflecting the productive and commercial capacity of each region and serving as an indicator of the flow and balance of the galactic economic network.

The financial structure is complemented by systems of credit, staking, and vesting, where debts, investments, and guarantees condition access to free capital and the sharing of real profits. **Starports** and **trade routes** act as strategic nodes for balance and conversion, while corporations and guilds compete for control of infrastructure and economic flows. This design allows player activity to fuel a cycle of value generation that is sustainable and self-regulated, where profitability and economic dominance are achieved through management, investment, and territorial control.

In this model, rewards are distributed based on participation and performance within the network, linking economic growth to the expansion of the universe and the opening of new routes and colonies. **The Corporate Wars** turns every strategic decision into a move in an economic war, where true power is measured in assets, capital, and control of the galactic commercial network.

# Non Fungible Tokens

In **The Corporate Wars**, **NFTs** represent unique assets and exclusive rights within the persistent universe, granting players and corporations direct control over key elements of the economy, production, and interstellar governance. Each **NFT** is an on-chain asset that guarantees ownership and traceability of facilities, ships, trade routes, concessions, or industrial designs, becoming an essential part of the game’s economic infrastructure and a reflection of each player’s power and influence on the galactic map.

These assets are not only tradable and leaseable but can also be used as financial backing in banking or commercial operations. The system also enables the creation of **Play to Earn (P2E)** scholarships, where players with large asset portfolios can temporarily lease the management of their **NFTs** to other players or teams in exchange for a share of the profits. This opens the door to complex synergies and strategic collaborations between players of different levels, facilitating expansion, route exploitation, or the management of multiple operations in a decentralized manner, while generating shared income and optimizing the use of available assets.

# Tokenized Facilities

**Tokenized Facilities** represent any structure, enclave, or operational unit within the universe of **The Corporate Wars**, including spacecraft considered as mobile facilities. Each facility is a unique **NFT** that grants its owner full control over its exploitation, operation, and productive or strategic capacity, functioning as an economic node within the galactic network. Tokenization ensures its traceability, market value, and its ability to be leased, transferred, or used as financial collateral in complex operations.

From starports and refineries to trade stations, orbital platforms, or entire fleets, these facilities define the material presence and economic power of a corporation or player in known space. In addition to generating revenue, providing logistical support, or serving as operational bases, each facility has a direct impact on the ability of systems and routes to mobilize and transform resources. Controlling them not only offers strategic advantages but also alters the local and regional economic balance.

The influence of these facilities goes beyond the operational: they are key pieces in the macroeconomic dynamics of **Resource Units (RUs)**. By being installed on a world or system, they modify its capacity for production, extraction, or transformation of **RUs**, affecting the flow and valuation of resources within the interstellar trade network. In this way, tokenized facilities become the link between capital invested in **MCr** and productive value expressed in **RUs**, turning each infrastructure investment into an economic move that reconfigures the galactic map and its trade routes.

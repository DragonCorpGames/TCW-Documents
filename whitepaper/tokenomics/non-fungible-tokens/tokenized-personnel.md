# Tokenized Personnel

In **The Corporate Wars**, specialized personnel — officers, captains, scientists, engineers, or even spies — can be represented as **NFTs**, reflecting their experience, skills, and strategic value within the persistent universe. Each of these unique assets possesses attributes that directly impact the performance of the operations they are assigned to, whether leading a fleet, managing a facility, or carrying out covert missions. Like any other tokenized resource, this personnel can be transferred, traded, or integrated into the operational structure of corporations and players.

Additionally, the system allows for the subcontracting and temporary leasing of tokenized personnel, opening the door to more complex dynamics such as the assignment of experts for specific operations or the appearance of double agents and loyalty conflicts. In this context, a player or corporation may benefit from — or be betrayed by — the decisions or actions of specialized personnel in the hands of third parties, generating situations of risk and political strategy. Personnel management is not just a matter of skills; it is a game of power, influence, and control over the individuals who, in many cases, will ultimately determine the success or failure of major galactic operations.

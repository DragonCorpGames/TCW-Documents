# Tokenized Rights

In **The Corporate Wars**, **tokenized rights** are **NFTs** that represent exclusive control over strategic resources, planetary concessions, trade routes, or exploitation zones within the gameâ€™s universe. These rights grant their owner the ability to operate and extract value directly from the assets they control, becoming key components within the economic and political structure of each star region.

Beyond simple exploitation, these **NFTs** can be leased or traded on the interstellar market, allowing the owner to generate passive income or finance new operations through the temporary transfer of their rights. Controlling these tokenized assets not only ensures a constant source of profit but also opens up strategic opportunities to influence the flow of resources and the balance of power within the galactic economic network.

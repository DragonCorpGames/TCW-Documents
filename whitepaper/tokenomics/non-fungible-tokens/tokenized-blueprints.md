# Tokenized Blueprints

**Tokenized Industrial Designs and Patents** represent the pinnacle of technological economy in **The Corporate Wars**. These **Tokenized Designs** are the result of the most advanced **R\&D** and allow their owners to control not only production but also the reproduction and evolution of strategic technologies. From new ship models and defense platforms to energy systems, tactical software, or innovations in equipment, each **NFT** blueprint grants exclusive rights over its exploitation and production within the persistent universe.

Owning one of these blueprints not only guarantees profitability through mass production or licensing agreements, but also allows for technological improvements that can alter the game’s balance. These patents can unlock new mechanics, offer competitive advantages, or even enable entirely new systems within the galactic ecosystem, redefining the rules of the market and corporate warfare. The race for control of these designs thus becomes a competition for technological superiority, where every innovation can shape the future of factions, trade routes, and entire systems.

In this environment, **R\&D** stops being just an operational expense and becomes a high-impact strategic investment capable of altering the game’s economy and power dynamics. **Tokenized Designs** are unique pieces of knowledge and economic dominion, encoded on the blockchain and intended for players and corporations who understand that in **The Corporate Wars**, technology is power, and ideas are the most valuable resource in the universe.

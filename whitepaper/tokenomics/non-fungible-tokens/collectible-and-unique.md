# Collectible and Unique

Finally, the universe of **The Corporate Wars** integrates collectibles and unique pieces that transcend their functional value to become symbols of prestige, power, and influence within the galactic economy. These exclusive **NFTs** represent rare artifacts, relics from vanished civilizations, prizes from unique campaigns, or achievements linked to major economic and political milestones. Each one carries symbolic and cultural value that reinforces the status of its owners within the network of corporations and entities in the game.

Beyond their value in **MCr**, these assets can influence relationships and strategic opportunities, unlocking special events, routes, or markets, and becoming coveted pieces within the high-level economy. Owning these relics not only reflects a corporation's success and ability to compete at the highest echelons but also opens the door to new forms of speculation and negotiation in a market where prestige and real scarcity also become tangible economic power.

# Milestones

**Project Start**\
**1-1-2025** - New year, new project. Ideas mature, and the technology is available; everything falls into place.

**Document Publication**\
**31-3-2025** - The arduous task of reflecting the concepts in an intelligible way for most humans is complete.

**Gameplay Prototyping**\
Currently in process. In this stage, we are developing the basic client gameplay in **Unreal Engine 5**, implementing the macroeconomy on **Solana devnet**, and developing the game’s secure APIs and services.

**Alphatest**\
Deployment of blockchain infrastructure on **Solana testnet**, low-performance cloud servers. Analyzing gameplay improvements and economic balance. Adjustments to blockchain dynamics, automation, and batching of transactions with no fees for users.

**Fundraising**\
Start of commercial product development, ICO launch, and **MCr** vesting contracts on **Solana mainnet**. Recruitment and operational kick-off, preparing to conquer the interstellar economy.

**Betatest**\
Launch on **Epic Games**, full gameplay, no DLC, no Pay to Win, no exclusive marketplaces — just **The Corporate Wars**, install, link wallet, and recapitalize the company from day 0 because you didn’t understand what this is about.

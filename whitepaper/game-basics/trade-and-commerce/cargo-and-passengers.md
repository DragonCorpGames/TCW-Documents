# Cargo and Passengers

The transportation of goods and people is one of the most fundamental economic activities in **The Corporate Wars**. Corporations and independent operators compete to move valuable cargo and travelers across the galaxy, ensuring the flow of essential products and connecting civilizations among the stars.

Cargo transport ranges from raw materials extracted from asteroid belts to manufactured products ready for distribution in interstellar markets. The efficiency of a transport fleet and the security of trade routes determine the cost and availability of these goods. Corporations that control access to these corridors can impose tariffs, block competitors, or ensure supply to strategic systems.

Passenger transport is equally crucial, enabling the movement of colonists, executives, workers, and travelers between distant worlds. While some opt for luxury starliners, others must settle for commercial passage aboard adapted freighters. In the most dangerous frontiers, interstellar mobility may depend on armed escorts or clandestine transporters willing to defy blockades and regulations.

Passenger and cargo routes are not only a source of wealth but also potential conflict zones. Piracy, trade embargoes, and restrictive regulations all impact the flow of commerce, making fleet management a matter of both financial strategy and operational security.

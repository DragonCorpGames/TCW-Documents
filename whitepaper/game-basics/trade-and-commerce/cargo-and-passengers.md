# Cargo and Passengers

The transportation of goods and passengers is one of the most fundamental economic activities in The Corporate Wars. Corporations and independent operators compete to move valuable cargo and travelers across the galaxy, ensuring the flow of essential products and connecting civilizations among the stars.

Freight transport ranges from raw materials extracted from asteroid belts to manufactured goods ready for interstellar markets. The efficiency of a transport fleet and the security of trade routes dictate costs and availability. Corporations that control access to these corridors can impose tariffs, block competitors, or guarantee supplies to strategic systems.

Passenger transport is equally crucial, enabling the mobility of colonists, executives, workers, and travelers between distant worlds. While some opt for luxury passage aboard starliners, others must settle for commercial berths on repurposed freighters. In dangerous frontier zones, interstellar mobility may depend on armed escorts or clandestine transporters willing to defy blockades and regulations.

Passenger and freight routes are not only a source of wealth—they are also targets of conflict. Piracy, trade embargoes, and restrictive regulations disrupt commerce, making transport fleet management both a financial and security challenge. Those who dominate logistics and route control shape the economic and political landscape of the galaxy.

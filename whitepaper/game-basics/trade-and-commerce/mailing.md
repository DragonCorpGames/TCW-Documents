# Mailing

Interstellar mail is the only reliable method of transmitting information between star systems, due to the absence of faster-than-light communication in The Corporate Wars. In a galaxy where time and distance dictate the pace of business and diplomacy, the physical transport of data, contracts, government orders, and personal correspondence is a critical industry.

Interstellar courier fleets operate through optimized logistics networks, using efficient jump corridors and strategic starports to minimize delivery delays. Some routes are well-established, offering regular mail services that ensure a constant flow of information between major economic and political centers. Others, however, rely on independent transporters and unsecured corridors, where data integrity can be compromised by piracy, embargos, or interference from rival entities.

Corporations that dominate interstellar messaging can directly influence market stability and communication security. Controlling the flow of data allows them to prioritize critical information, delay competitor access to strategic intelligence, or even manipulate perceptions in isolated systems. In this environment, information is not just power—it is a commodity as valuable as any other resource in the galaxy.

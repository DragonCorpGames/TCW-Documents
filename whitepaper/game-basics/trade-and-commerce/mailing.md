# Mailing

Interstellar mail is the only reliable means of transmitting information between star systems due to the absence of faster-than-light communications in **The Corporate Wars**. In a galaxy where time and distance dictate the speed of business and diplomacy, the physical transport of data, contracts, government orders, and personal correspondence is a vital industry.

Interstellar courier fleets operate through optimized logistical networks, using efficient jump corridors and strategic spaceports to minimize delivery delays. Some routes are well established, with regular courier services ensuring a constant flow of information between the galaxy’s major economic and political centers. Others rely on independent carriers and unsecured routes, where information may be compromised by pirates, embargoes, or interference from rival entities.

Corporations that dominate interstellar messaging can directly influence market stability and communication security. Controlling the flow of data allows them to prioritize critical information, delay competitors’ access to strategic intelligence, or even manipulate perceptions of events in isolated systems. In this environment, information is not just power — it is a commodity as valuable as any other resource in the galaxy.

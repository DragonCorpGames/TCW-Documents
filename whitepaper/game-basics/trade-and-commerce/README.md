# Trade and Commerce

Trade and commerce are the driving force of interstellar civilization in The Corporate Wars. The ability to exchange goods, services, and wealth across star systems defines corporate growth and the stability of interplanetary societies. From highly regulated markets to free trade enclaves, each region of the galaxy presents unique opportunities and challenges for those seeking to capitalize on the constant flow of resources.

Interstellar markets operate within a complex framework, where supply and demand are influenced by transport availability, political stability, and regulatory oversight from governments and trade institutions. Some zones are controlled by corporate monopolies, while others allow open competition, fostering a dynamic economic ecosystem where players can shape prices and resource availability.

Logistics and trade route management are critical factors in the galactic economy. Corporations that control high-traffic corridors or strategic distribution hubs can impose tariffs, restrict competitor access, or ensure dominance over key sectors of production and consumption. In this landscape, trade is not just a means of generating wealth—it is a tool of power.

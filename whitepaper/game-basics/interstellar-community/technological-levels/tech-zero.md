# Tech Zero

Tech Zero civilizations are societies that have not yet achieved significant technological development. Many of them are tribal cultures or early-stage civilizations, completely unaware of the existence of other species in the galaxy. Their understanding of the universe is limited to their immediate surroundings and their own cultural evolution.

Despite their isolation, these worlds do not always go unnoticed by interstellar powers. Some advanced civilizations establish exclusion zones to avoid any interference in their natural development, while others see them as future territories for colonization or exploitation.

The impact of contact with an interstellar society can be either devastating or transformative. An uncontrolled introduction to advanced technologies could destabilize their social evolution, while a gradual integration process might turn them into long-term strategic allies. For corporations, these worlds typically represent long-term opportunities rather than immediate markets, though their position in the galaxy may make them attractive as future expansion enclaves.

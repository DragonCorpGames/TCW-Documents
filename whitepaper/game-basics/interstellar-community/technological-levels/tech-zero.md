# Tech Zero

Tech Zero civilizations are societies that have yet to reach any significant technological development. Many exist as tribal cultures or early-stage civilizations, completely unaware of the presence of other species in the galaxy. Their understanding of the universe is limited to their immediate environment and cultural evolution, with no concept of interstellar society.

Despite their isolation, these worlds do not always go unnoticed by interstellar powers. Some advanced civilizations establish exclusion zones to prevent any interference with their natural development, while others see them as potential targets for future colonization or resource exploitation.

Contact with an interstellar society can be either devastating or transformative. A sudden introduction to advanced technology can destabilize their social evolution, while a gradual integration process may turn them into long-term strategic allies. For corporations, Tech Zero worlds are often seen as long-term investments rather than immediate markets, but their location and resource potential can make them highly attractive as future expansion enclaves.

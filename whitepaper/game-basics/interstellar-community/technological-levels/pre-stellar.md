# Pre-Stellar

Pre-stellar civilizations have developed advanced technology within their home systems, but they have yet to discover jump travel, limiting them to sublight exploration methods. Despite this restriction, many have colonized their moons or neighboring planets, established interplanetary economies, and built complex industrial infrastructures.

Contact with interstellar civilizations represents a turning point in their history. Some advanced powers prefer non-interference, monitoring these societies from hidden bases or enforcing strict trade restrictions. Others, however, see these worlds as strategic opportunities, establishing trade agreements, offering technology in exchange for grants, or integrating them into their sphere of influence.

For corporations, these systems represent emerging markets and untapped resource reserves. Managing contact effectively can lead to lucrative alliances or controlled economic exploitation. However, pre-stellar societies do not always accept external influence willingly, and aggressive expansion efforts can trigger local conflicts or resistance to foreign intervention.

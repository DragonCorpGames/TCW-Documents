# Pre-Stellar

Pre-stellar civilizations have developed advanced technology within their own star systems but have not yet discovered interstellar jump travel, limiting them to subluminal exploration methods. Despite this, many have colonized nearby moons or planets, established interplanetary economies, and developed complex industrial infrastructures.

Contact with interstellar civilizations marks a turning point in their history. Some advanced powers prefer not to interfere in their development, observing them from hidden bases or enforcing strict trade restrictions. However, others see these worlds as strategic opportunities, establishing trade agreements, offering technology in exchange for concessions, or integrating them into their sphere of influence.

For corporations, these systems represent emerging markets and untapped resource sources. Proper management of first contact can lead to lucrative alliances or the controlled exploitation of their economies. However, pre-stellar societies do not always accept external influence without resistance, and attempts at domination can trigger local conflicts or pushback against foreign intervention.

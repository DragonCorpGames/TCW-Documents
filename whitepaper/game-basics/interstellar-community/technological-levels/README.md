# Technological Levels

Technological advancement defines a civilization’s development trajectory and its ability to expand beyond its homeworld. The Technology Level (TL) system categorizes societies based on their scientific knowledge, infrastructure sophistication, and integration into the interstellar network. From primitive cultures to galactic empires, each civilization exists within a technological spectrum that determines its opportunities, challenges, and relationships with other entities.

Since faster-than-light communication does not exist, civilizations that have not yet developed jump technology are confined to their home systems. Without a means of traveling between stars within reasonable timeframes, these societies must sustain themselves by managing local resources and advancing their knowledge until they reach the threshold of interstellar exploration.

More advanced societies have overcome these limitations, building entire economies around interstellar mobility. A civilization’s Technology Level not only determines its ability to expand but also its standing within the galactic order. TL-9 societies may be on the verge of an interstellar revolution, while TL-5 worlds still depend on fossil fuels and terrestrial telecommunications. This disparity in technological development creates asymmetrical power dynamics, allowing more advanced civilizations to dictate the fate of those that lag behind.

Corporations play a key role in this equation, acting as catalysts for technological development by providing technology and resources in exchange for strategic grants. At the same time, corporations may also intentionally slow down progress on certain worlds to maintain commercial or political advantages. In a universe where access to information and mobility defines power, a civilization’s Technology Level is the decisive factor in shaping its influence across the galaxy.

| **TL**  | **Development Stage** |
|---------|-------------------------|
| **0**  | Primitive societies with no writing or advanced technology. Fully dependent on rudimentary tools and empirical knowledge. |
| **1**  | Early civilization. Development of metallurgy, agriculture, and the first writing systems. |
| **2**  | Expansion of trade and navigation. Early engineering advancements and bureaucratic structures. |
| **3**  | Gunpowder usage, mechanical development, and global terrestrial and maritime exploration. |
| **4**  | Industrial revolution. Steam and electricity, early experiments in mechanical flight. |
| **5**  | Fossil fuel era. Early telecommunications, computing, and initial space exploration. |
| **6**  | Nuclear energy development. Advanced space exploration within home systems. Emerging automation and biotechnology. |
| **7**  | Limited planetary colonization. Advancements in nuclear fusion, computing, and early artificial intelligence. |
| **8**  | Sustainable space infrastructure. Industrial expansion beyond the homeworld, development of artificial gravity systems. |
| **9**  | Emerging interstellar economy. Experimental technologies pushing civilization toward jump travel. |
| **10** | Mastery of interstellar travel. Jump drive development enables transport and communication between star systems. |
| **11+** | Civilizations with highly advanced technology, fully integrated economies, industries, and societies at an interstellar level. |

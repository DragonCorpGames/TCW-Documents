# Established Institutions

These are the regulatory, economic, and political entities that operate across the galaxy, providing structure and stability to interstellar society. While major powers and planetary governments exert territorial control, these institutions function across borders, overseeing commercial activity, ensuring interstellar security, and managing relations between civilizations, corporations, and autonomous entities.

Some of these institutions have emerged through multilateral agreements, establishing trade standards, exploration protocols, and military intervention policies in disputed zones. Others operate with a corporate mandate, regulating contracts, arbitration, and industrial standards to ensure economic interoperability across the galaxy. Their level of authority varies by region, and in some cases, they are little more than symbolic entities with no real enforcement power.

For corporations in The Corporate Wars, these institutions can be both a bureaucratic obstacle and a strategic tool. Compliance with their regulations and securing institutional backing can grant access to exclusive markets and legal protections, while operating outside their framework carries significant risks—from sanctions and trade embargoes to direct intervention.

The balance between regulation and autonomy defines the power struggle within the galaxy. While some institutions seek to preserve the status quo, others provide just enough flexibility for the boldest corporations to rewrite the rules in their favor.

# Established Institutions

Established Institutions are the regulatory, economic, and political organizations that operate across the galaxy, providing structure and stability to interstellar society. While major powers and governments control vast territories, these organizations function transversally — regulating commercial activity, ensuring interstellar security, and managing relations between civilizations, corporations, and autonomous entities.

Some of these institutions have emerged from agreements between multiple governments, establishing rules for trade, exploration, and military intervention in disputed zones. Others operate under corporate mandates, regulating contracts, arbitrations, and industrial standards to guarantee interoperability within the galactic economy. Their level of authority varies by region, and in some cases, they are little more than symbolic entities with no real ability to enforce their regulations.

For corporations in **The Corporate Wars**, these institutions can represent both a bureaucratic obstacle and a strategic tool. Complying with their regulations and earning their backing can grant access to exclusive markets and legal protections, while operating outside their framework involves significant risks — from sanctions to trade blockades or even direct interventions.

The balance between regulation and autonomy defines the power game across the galaxy. While some institutions aim to preserve the status quo, others allow enough flexibility for bold corporations to rewrite the rules in their favor.

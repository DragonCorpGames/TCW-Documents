# Law and Government

The Known Space is not a lawless frontier—it is shaped by a complex web of regulatory structures and political entities that define authority, jurisdiction, and the legal framework in which civilizations, corporations, and independent actors operate. From interstellar empires and trade alliances to planetary governments, every entity seeks to enforce its sovereignty, though the vastness of space often challenges these claims.

The reach of government varies greatly between systems. Some powers establish highly centralized administrations, where interstellar laws are strictly enforced and regulatory agencies oversee trade, security, and space traffic compliance. Other regions operate under decentralized models, where authority is fragmented, and law enforcement relies on agreements between local factions, corporations, or informal power structures.

| **Code** | **Government Type**          | **Description** |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **0**   | None                        | No centralized government. Often abandoned territories, scattered tribal societies, or regions in total anarchy. |
| **1**   | Corporate Government        | A world governed entirely by a corporation or business consortium, where laws and regulations serve commercial interests. |
| **2**   | Participatory Democracy     | A direct democracy where citizens vote on government decisions without representatives. |
| **3**   | Bureaucracy                 | A government run by an intricate network of agencies and officials, where power lies in administrative systems. |
| **4**   | Representative Dictatorship | A system where a restricted elite controls the government, often claiming to act in the people's interest, with limited or non-existent elections. |
| **5**   | Feudalism                    | A hierarchy of loyalty-based governance, where regional rulers manage territories under a supreme leader. |
| **6**   | Military Government          | A state governed by armed forces, with policies dictated by military leadership rather than civilian rule. |
| **7**   | Oligarchy                    | Power is concentrated in the hands of a few influential individuals, such as powerful families, clans, or elite alliances. |
| **8**   | Monarchy                     | A government led by a single ruler, such as a king or emperor, with hereditary or appointed succession. |
| **9**   | Impersonal Government        | A system where laws are applied with strict, inflexible enforcement, often managed by artificial intelligence or automated protocols. |
| **10**  | Religious Government         | A theocratic state where political and spiritual leadership are intertwined, with laws dictated by religious doctrines. |
| **11**  | Assisted Government          | Authority is maintained by an advanced AI or computational network guiding government decisions. |
| **12**  | Clans or Tribes              | Small-scale governance based on family ties, tradition, or cultural affiliation, lacking a centralized authority. |
| **13**  | Rebel State                  | A government in active conflict or insurgency against a larger power, operating under wartime conditions. |
| **14**  | Collapsed State              | A failed government with no effective leadership, where control rests with warlords, militias, or disputing factions. |
| **15**  | Autarkic State               | An isolationist government that restricts trade and external influence to maintain absolute internal control. |

Corporations play a critical role in this power structure. Many have secured legal rights that allow them to operate as de facto states in territories under their control, enforcing their own regulations and policies within their facilities, fleets, and colonies. In some cases, interstellar powers delegate entire system administration to corporate entities, making them key players in trade, security, and diplomacy.

Despite attempts to enforce order, the vastness of space and communication delays make law enforcement inconsistent. On the farthest frontiers, the influence of major governments fades, creating regions where authority is contested between factions, pirates, militias, and corporate syndicates. Here, loyalty to the law is a matter of pragmatism, and survival depends on navigating the intricate power dynamics of interstellar governance.

| **Code** | **Law Level**                | **Description** |
|---------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| **0**   | No Regulations               | No formal laws. Any activity is permitted, including unrestricted violence. Total anarchy. |

| **2**   | Light Control                | Some restrictions exist, mainly to maintain public order. Personal weapons are allowed, and economic regulation is minimal. |

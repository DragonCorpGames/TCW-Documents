# Law and Government

Known space is not a void of anarchy; it is governed by a complex network of regulatory structures and political entities that establish order, jurisdiction, and the legal framework in which civilizations, corporations, and independent actors operate. From vast interstellar empires to trade alliances and planetary governments, each entity seeks to exert authority within its borders â€” though the realities of the galaxy often challenge these ambitions.

The reach of government varies greatly from system to system. Some powers establish highly centralized administrations, where interstellar laws are rigidly enforced and regulatory bodies oversee compliance with trade, security, and space traffic regulations. Other regions operate under decentralized models, where authority is fragmented and law enforcement depends on agreements between local factions, corporations, or informal power groups.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="91"></th><th width="242"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Code</strong></td><td><strong>Government Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>0</strong></td><td>None</td><td>No centralized government. Often abandoned territories, scattered tribal societies, or regions in total anarchy.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1</strong></td><td>Corporate Government</td><td>A world governed entirely by a corporation or business consortium, where laws and regulations serve commercial interests.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2</strong></td><td>Participatory Democracy</td><td>A direct democracy where citizens vote on government decisions without representatives.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3</strong></td><td>Bureaucracy</td><td>A government run by an intricate network of agencies and officials, where power lies in administrative systems.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4</strong></td><td>Representative Dictatorship</td><td>A system where a restricted elite controls the government, often claiming to act in the people's interest, with limited or non-existent elections.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5</strong></td><td>Feudalism</td><td>A hierarchy of loyalty-based governance, where regional rulers manage territories under a supreme leader.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6</strong></td><td>Military Government</td><td>A state governed by armed forces, with policies dictated by military leadership rather than civilian rule.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>7</strong></td><td>Oligarchy</td><td>Power is concentrated in the hands of a few influential individuals, such as powerful families, clans, or elite alliances.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>8</strong></td><td>Monarchy</td><td>A government led by a single ruler, such as a king or emperor, with hereditary or appointed succession.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9</strong></td><td>Impersonal Government</td><td>A system where laws are applied with strict, inflexible enforcement, often managed by artificial intelligence or automated protocols.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>10</strong></td><td>Religious Government</td><td>A theocratic state where political and spiritual leadership are intertwined, with laws dictated by religious doctrines.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>11</strong></td><td>Assisted Government</td><td>Authority is maintained by an advanced AI or computational network guiding government decisions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>12</strong></td><td>Clans or Tribes</td><td>Small-scale governance based on family ties, tradition, or cultural affiliation, lacking a centralized authority.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>13</strong></td><td>Rebel State</td><td>A government in active conflict or insurgency against a larger power, operating under wartime conditions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>14</strong></td><td>Collapsed State</td><td>A failed government with no effective leadership, where control rests with warlords, militias, or disputing factions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>15</strong></td><td>Autarkic State</td><td>An isolationist government that restricts trade and external influence to maintain absolute internal control.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Corporations play a fundamental role in this equation. Many have acquired legal rights that allow them to operate as de facto states within the territories they control, enforcing their own regulations and laws within their facilities, fleets, and colonies. In some cases, galactic powers delegate the administration of entire systems to them, making corporations key players in the management of trade, security, and interstellar diplomacy.

Despite efforts to maintain order, the vastness of space and communication barriers make law enforcement inconsistent. In the outer frontiers, the influence of major governments fades, giving rise to territories where authority is contested by factions, pirates, militias, and corporate consortiums. In this environment, loyalty to the law is often a matter of pragmatism, and survival depends on the ability to navigate the complex dynamics of interstellar power.

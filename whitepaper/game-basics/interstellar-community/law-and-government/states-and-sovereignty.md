# States and Sovereignty

Sovereignty in interstellar space is a flexible and constantly contested concept. Unlike worlds unified under a single government, the galaxy is fragmented into a myriad of territories with different forms of administration — from centralized empires to corporate colonies with no significant civilian population. In this context, the concept of "state" is not limited to traditional governments but also includes private entities with enough power to exert control over a territory.

For corporations in **The Corporate Wars**, sovereignty is not merely a legal matter but a strategic tool. A corporate colony with self-sufficient infrastructure and no other inhabitants beyond its staff is, in essence, a world entirely governed by a company. These colonies may operate under agreements with major powers, within autonomous zones, or even in uncharted regions where no higher authority can claim jurisdiction.

Corporate territorial control grants unique advantages and challenges. A corporation that governs a world can establish its own laws, regulate trade in its favor, and monopolize local resources without external interference. However, this also makes it a target in interstellar politics: it may be pressured to comply with treaties imposed by larger entities, face disputes with other corporations, or even resist annexation attempts by major powers.

A corporation’s sovereignty is not always guaranteed. In contested sectors, the legitimacy of territorial control can be challenged by governments, local insurgencies, or even mercenary forces hired by rivals. Maintaining control over a territory requires not only military and administrative strength but also diplomacy and intelligence to navigate the interests at play.

In a universe where power is as malleable as the contracts that sustain it, sovereignty becomes a currency — and in **The Corporate Wars**, each corporation must decide whether to play by the system’s rules or become an entity that seeks to rewrite them in its favor.

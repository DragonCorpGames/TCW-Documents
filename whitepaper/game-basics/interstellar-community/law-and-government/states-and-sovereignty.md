# States and Sovereignty

Sovereignty in interstellar space is a fluid and constantly contested concept. Unlike worlds unified under a single government, the galaxy is fractured into countless territories, each with distinct methods of governance—ranging from centralized empires to corporate colonies with no civilian population. In this landscape, the idea of a state is not restricted to traditional governments but also extends to private entities with enough power to control a territory.

For corporations in The Corporate Wars, sovereignty is not just a legal matter but a strategic tool. A corporate colony with self-sufficient infrastructure and no inhabitants beyond its personnel is, in essence, a world entirely governed by a company. These colonies can operate under agreements with major powers, function within autonomous zones, or even exist in uncharted regions where no higher authority can claim jurisdiction.

Corporate territorial control comes with unique advantages and challenges. A corporation ruling a world can set its own laws, regulate trade to its benefit, and monopolize local resources without external interference. However, this also makes it a target of interstellar politics—it may face pressure to comply with treaties imposed by larger entities, disputes with rival corporations, or even attempts at annexation by greater powers.

Corporate sovereignty is never guaranteed. In contested sectors, the legitimacy of territorial control can be challenged by governments, local insurgencies, or even mercenary forces hired by competitors. Maintaining dominion over a territory requires not only military and administrative strength but also diplomacy and intelligence to navigate competing interests.

In a universe where power is as malleable as the contracts that uphold it, sovereignty is a currency—and in The Corporate Wars, every corporation must decide whether to play by the system’s rules or rewrite them in its favor.

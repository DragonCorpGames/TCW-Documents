# Major Powers

The major powers of the galaxy are the political, military, and economic entities that dominate vast regions of space, shaping interstellar politics and setting the rules of the game for civilizations, corporations, and independent actors. These factions are not merely expanding states, but institutions with centuries or even millennia of history, whose reach extends far beyond a single star system or sector.

For players in **The Corporate Wars**, major powers are neither accessible nor controllable factions. They represent both balance and challenge within the game â€” forces that can either support or hinder the growth of a corporation. In some cases, their laws and treaties define the operational limits within their territories; in others, they may become strategic allies or insurmountable obstacles.

Each power holds its own vision of interstellar expansion and interaction with lesser actors. Some favor centralized governance with strict policies, while others allow a high degree of autonomy along their borders. Many rely on corporations as intermediaries to manage their more remote sectors, delegating security, administration, and resource exploitation to private enterprises.

The vastness of space and the barriers of interstellar communication create fragmented zones of influence where the authority of these powers weakens. It is in these margins that players can operate with greater freedom, exploiting gaps in interstellar power to expand without being directly subjected to the will of a dominant faction. In these territories, the balance of power is unstable, and opportunities and threats constantly shift depending on the actions of the major powers and the ambitions of emerging actors.

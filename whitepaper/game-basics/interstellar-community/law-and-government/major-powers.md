# Major Powers

The major powers of the galaxy are the political, military, and economic superpowers that dominate vast regions of space, shaping interstellar politics and setting the rules of engagement for civilizations, corporations, and independent actors. These factions are not merely expanding states; they are institutions with centuries or even millennia of history, whose influence extends far beyond the borders of a single system or sector.

For players in The Corporate Wars, major powers are neither accessible nor controllable. They serve as the balance and challenge within the game, acting as forces that can either support or hinder a corporation’s growth. In some cases, their laws and treaties define operational limits, while in others, they may become strategic allies or insurmountable obstacles.

Each major power has its own vision of interstellar expansion and its relationship with smaller actors. Some enforce highly centralized governments with rigid policies, while others allow a greater degree of autonomy along their borders. Many rely on corporations as intermediaries to manage their more remote sectors, delegating security, administration, and resource exploitation to private enterprises.

However, the vastness of space and the barriers of interstellar communication create fragmented zones of influence, where a major power’s authority weakens or becomes inconsistent. It is within these gray areas that players can operate with greater freedom, exploiting loopholes in interstellar power structures to expand their influence without direct subjugation. In these contested territories, the balance of power is unstable, and opportunities and threats shift constantly, depending on the decisions of the major powers and the ambitions of emerging players.

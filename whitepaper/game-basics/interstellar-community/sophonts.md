# Sophonts

Interstellar societies are composed of numerous civilizations and intelligent species, collectively referred to as sophonts. These entities vary in their technological development, political structure, cultural identity, and methods of expansion across the galaxy. Some have built vast bureaucratic empires, while others operate as decentralized networks of trade, exploration, or territorial control.

The interaction between sophonts shapes the balance of power in the galaxy, directly impacting economics, politics, and security. Some civilizations enforce highly centralized structures where governments strictly regulate information flow and commerce, while others delegate authority to local or private entities. In this universe, corporations must adapt to the rules imposed by these actors—but they can also influence policies through diplomacy, investment, or direct conflict.

Biological and ideological differences among sophonts drive economic demand. Some species have unique industrial and logistical needs, creating specialized market opportunities for supplying goods, technology, and services. Meanwhile, rivalries between factions or species can lead to economic cold wars or open conflicts, in which corporations may act as mediators, security providers, or even instigators of destabilization for strategic gain.

In this environment, understanding sophonts is more than just diplomacy—it’s a strategic advantage that enables corporations to expand operations and consolidate power across the galaxy.

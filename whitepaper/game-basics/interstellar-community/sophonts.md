# Sophonts

Interstellar societies are composed of multiple civilizations and intelligent species, collectively known as _sophonts_. These entities vary in technological development, political structure, culture, and methods of expansion throughout the galaxy. Some have built vast bureaucratic empires, while others operate as decentralized networks focused on trade, exploration, or territorial dominance.

The interaction between sophonts defines the balance of power in the galaxy, directly impacting the economy, politics, and security. Some civilizations maintain highly centralized structures where governments rigidly control the flow of information and commerce, while others delegate authority to local or private systems. In this universe, corporations must not only adapt to the rules imposed by these actors but can also influence their policies through diplomacy, investment, or conflict.

Additionally, biological and ideological differences among sophonts affect the economy. Some species have unique industrial and logistical needs, creating commercial opportunities in the supply of goods, technology, and services. On the other hand, tensions between factions or species can escalate into economic cold wars or open conflicts, where corporations may intervene as mediators, security providers, or even as instigators of destabilization for profit.

In this environment, understanding sophonts is not just a matter of diplomacy â€” it is a strategic advantage for expanding operations and consolidating power across the galaxy.

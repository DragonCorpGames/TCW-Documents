# Interstellar Community

Multiple civilizations, governments, and species coexist in a vast interstellar community stretching across thousands of light-years, where the balance of power is shaped by the limitations of interstellar communication. Without an instantaneous data transmission infrastructure, the only means of faster-than-light communication is jump travel, making starships the primary vectors of information, trade, and diplomacy.

To sustain themselves, societies have developed efficient logistical networks, relay-based messaging systems, and decentralized governance models that allow for the synchronization of markets and large-scale political control. Major powers administer vast territories through local authorities with varying degrees of autonomy, while corporations have optimized the mobility of goods and information, thriving in an environment where communication delays are an inherent challenge.

Controlling these routes and optimizing response times is key to economic and political success. War, trade, and diplomacy all depend on each actor’s ability to manage transportation and communication networks, making logistics a fundamental strategic asset. Those who master interstellar mobility will consolidate their power and shape the future of the galaxy.

# Interstellar Community

Multiple civilizations, governments, and species coexist in a community spanning thousands of light-years, balanced by the limitations of interstellar communication. Without an infrastructure for instant data transmission, the only faster-than-light means of communication is interstellar jump travel, making ships with transit capability the primary vectors of information, trade, and diplomacy.

To survive, societies have developed efficient logistical networks, relay messaging systems, and decentralized governance models that allow market synchronization and large-scale political control. Major powers administer vast territories through local authorities with a certain degree of autonomy, while corporations have optimized the movement of goods and information to operate within an environment of constant communication delays.

Controlling these routes and optimizing response times is key to economic and political success. War, trade, and diplomacy depend on each actorâ€™s ability to manage their transportation and communication networks, turning logistics into a fundamental strategic element. Those who dominate interstellar mobility will consolidate their power and shape the future of the galaxy.

# Corporations

In an environment where instant communications are not viable, corporations represent the core of economic activity, interstellar expansion, and resource management.

They are both engines of development and weapons of influence, used to shape the balance of power in the galaxy.

Players can own and manage their own corporations, expanding their influence through various strategies—from resource exploitation, manufacturing, and trade, to security or financial services. Every business decision has repercussions on the interstellar economy, political relations, and territorial control.

Players must constantly evaluate their economic strategies and political relationships. Whether operating a planet or leading an independent fleet, the success of their corporation depends not only on internal management but also on their ability to thrive in the markets while navigating the challenges imposed by governments and regulatory entities.

Corporations have the power to define the future of the galaxy—whether through cooperation, ruthless competition, or strategic market manipulation. The key to success lies in a combination of business vision, aggressive tactics, and adaptability in an ever-changing universe.

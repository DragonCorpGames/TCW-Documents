# Corporations

In a setting where instant communication is not viable, corporations represent the core of economic activity, interstellar expansion, and resource management. They are both engines of development and weapons of influence, used to shape the balance of power across the galaxy.

Players can own and manage their own corporations, expanding their influence through various strategies — from resource exploitation, manufacturing, and goods trading to providing security or financial services. Every business decision has consequences for the interstellar economy, political relations, and territorial control.

Players must constantly assess their economic strategies and political relationships. Whether operating a planet or commanding an independent fleet, the success of their corporation depends as much on internal management as on their ability to thrive in the markets, navigating the challenges imposed by governments and regulatory entities.

Corporations have the power to define the future of the galaxy — through cooperation, ruthless competition, or strategic market manipulation. The key to success lies in a combination of business vision, aggressive tactics, and adaptability in a constantly changing universe.

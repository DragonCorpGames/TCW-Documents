# Mercantile and Freight

Mercantile and freight are the backbone of the interstellar economy. The ability to efficiently move goods, supplies, and people defines the success of any corporation. Specialized companies connect markets, distribute manufactured products, and keep key communication routes operational by managing fleets of freighters, trade stations, and logistical networks.

Corporations must optimize their transportation routes, ensure the protection of their convoys, and establish trade agreements with clients and strategic partners. A well-managed freight infrastructure not only enables the efficient flow of goods but can also be used to monopolize markets, control prices, and exert influence over emerging economies.

# Mercantile and Freight

Commerce and freight transport form the backbone of the interstellar economy. The ability to efficiently move goods, supplies, and personnel defines the success of any corporation. Specialized enterprises handle market connectivity, product distribution, and the maintenance of essential trade routes, managing fleets of freighters, trade hubs, and logistical networks.

Corporations must optimize their transport routes, safeguard their convoys, and establish trade agreements with clients and strategic partners. A well-managed freight infrastructure not only ensures a steady flow of commerce but also serves as a tool for market monopolization, price control, and economic influence over emerging systems. Those who dominate logistics dictate the flow of interstellar trade, positioning themselves as key players in The Corporate Wars.

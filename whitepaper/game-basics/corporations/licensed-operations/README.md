# Licensed Operations

In The Corporate Wars, corporations operate under the watchful eye of interstellar authorities, which regulate their activities through licenses, permits, tariffs, and taxation.

From their inception, corporations are authorized to conduct certain basic operations, typically accompanied by straightforward tax regulations. However, strategic or restricted activities require overcoming additional regulatory hurdles. These regulations are not just legal constraints; they also reflect the vested interests of the societies enforcing them.

Securing permits, licenses, and grants can be as challenging as it is profitable. Key sectors such as resource exploitation, private security, and financial operations are tightly controlled, requiring strict compliance to gain access. While some corporations meticulously follow every requirement, others find creative ways to expedite approvals or tilt the balance in their favor.

When establishing a new corporation, players must carefully determine the scope and extent of their operations, as each license comes with specific costs and requirements. Expanding too aggressively can significantly increase initial complexity and operational challenges, making strategic planning essential to corporate success.

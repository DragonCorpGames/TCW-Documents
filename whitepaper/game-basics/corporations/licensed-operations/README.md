# Licensed Operations

In **The Corporate Wars**, corporations operate under the watchful eye of interstellar authorities, which regulate their activities through licenses, permits, tariffs, and taxes.

From their founding, each corporation is granted authorization for certain basic operations, usually accompanied by simple fiscal regulations, while strategic or restricted activities require overcoming additional filters. These regulations not only impose limits but also reflect the interests of the societies that enforce them.

Obtaining permits, licenses, and concessions can become as challenging as it is profitable. Key sectors such as resource exploitation, private security, and financial manipulation are subject to strict regulations designed to restrict access and maintain control. While some corporations meticulously comply with every requirement, others find creative ways to fast-track procedures or tip the balance in their favor.

When registering a new corporation, players must decide the scope and reach of their operations, keeping in mind that each license carries specific costs and requirements â€” exponentially increasing the initial difficulty and the complexity of corporate management within the game.

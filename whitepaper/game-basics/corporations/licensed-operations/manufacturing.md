# Manufacturing

Manufacturing is the process by which raw materials are transformed into finished products â€” from consumer goods to industrial equipment and spacecraft. It is a core activity for the economic growth of any corporation, enabling production scaling, revenue generation, and the strengthening of internal infrastructure.

Corporations build and optimize factories, assembly lines, and distribution centers. They must efficiently manage the production chain, ensuring a constant flow of resources from grant exploitation to the delivery of the final product.

Factors such as automation, specialization, and logistics play a key role in the competitiveness of a manufacturing corporation. Those capable of establishing efficient and well-integrated production can dominate entire markets, influence the interstellar economy, and solidify their position as indispensable players in **The Corporate Wars**.

Corporations starting their operations in the manufacturing sector must balance supply with product demand to succeed. They are suitable for players who prefer generating technology as a source of income rather than relying on it in the long term.

# Manufacturing

Manufacturing is the process through which raw materials are transformed into finished products, ranging from consumer goods to industrial equipment and spacecraft.

It is a central activity for the economic development of any corporation, enabling production scaling, revenue generation, and the strengthening of internal infrastructure.

Corporations must build and optimize factories, assembly lines, and distribution centers. They must efficiently manage the production chain, ensuring a steady flow of resources from concession exploitation to final product delivery.

Factors such as automation, specialization, and logistics play a crucial role in the competitiveness of a manufacturing corporation. Those that establish an efficient and well-integrated production system can dominate entire markets, influence the interstellar economy, and solidify their position as key players in _The Corporate Wars_.

Corporations that begin their operations in the manufacturing sector must balance supply with product demand to succeed.

They are suitable for players who prefer to generate technology as a source of income rather than rely on it in the long run.

# Manufacturing

Manufacturing is the process by which raw materials are transformed into finished products, ranging from consumer goods to industrial equipment and starships. It is a core economic activity for any corporation, enabling mass production, revenue generation, and the expansion of infrastructure.

Corporations establish and optimize factories, assembly lines, and distribution centers, ensuring a continuous flow of resources from grant exploitation to the final delivery of products. Efficient supply chain management is critical to maintaining steady production and minimizing operational costs.

Key factors such as automation, specialization, and logistics define a corporation’s competitiveness in the sector. Those that master the art of integrated and scalable production can dominate entire markets, shape the interstellar economy, and cement themselves as indispensable players in The Corporate Wars.

# Enforcement and Security

Ensuring the safety of settlements, trade routes, and strategic assets requires constant investment in technology, training, and personnel deployment. Corporations specialized in Law Enforcement and Security relieve this burden from governments, colonies, and companies by offering comprehensive solutions for asset protection and operational stability.

These corporations provide trained personnel, tactical equipment, surveillance systems, defense protocols, and risk management strategies. Their operations involve building and maintaining security infrastructure, optimizing the deployment of protection units, and managing resources dedicated to defense.

A well-managed security corporation can not only safeguard its own assets and those of others but also establish a monopoly over planetary protection â€” turning security into a profitable and strategically crucial industry.

# Enforcement and Security

Ensuring security in settlements, trade routes, and strategic assets requires constant investment in technology, training, and personnel deployment.

Corporations specializing in enforcement and security relieve this burden for governments, colonies, and businesses by offering comprehensive solutions for asset protection and operational stability.

These corporations provide trained personnel, tactical equipment, surveillance systems, defense protocols, and risk management strategies. Their operations involve constructing and maintaining security infrastructure, optimizing the deployment of protective units, and managing resources dedicated to defense.

A well-managed security corporation can not only safeguard its own and third-party assets but also establish a monopoly over planetary protection, turning security into a profitable and strategically crucial industry.

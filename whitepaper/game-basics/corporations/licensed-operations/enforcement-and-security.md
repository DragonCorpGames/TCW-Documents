# Enforcement and Security

Ensuring security across settlements, trade routes, and strategic assets requires continuous investment in technology, personnel training, and force deployment. Corporations specializing in Enforcement and Security relieve governments, colonies, and enterprises from the burden of managing their own protection, offering comprehensive solutions for asset defense and operational stability.

These corporations provide trained personnel, tactical equipment, surveillance systems, defense protocols, and risk management strategies. Their role extends beyond simple protection, encompassing the construction and maintenance of security infrastructure, the optimization of defensive deployments, and the administration of resources dedicated to enforcement operations.

A well-managed security corporation is not just a service provider—it can establish a monopoly over planetary protection, turning security into a profitable and strategically vital industry. Those who control the enforcement sector dictate who operates safely and who faces constant risk, making it one of the most influential fields in the galaxy.

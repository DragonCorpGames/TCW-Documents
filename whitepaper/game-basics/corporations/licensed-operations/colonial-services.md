# Colonial Services

Developing worlds, newly contacted planets, and emerging colonies require critical infrastructure and essential services to function efficiently. Corporations step in to provide these services to independent colonial communities that prefer to focus on their primary industries—whether agricultural, industrial, or mining—without shouldering the burden of administrative and operational management.

These services include energy supply, waste management, potable water distribution, life support, communications, and logistics, among many other specialized needs.

Corporations operating in this sector act as support providers for settlements, leveraging interstellar markets to ensure that colonies can concentrate on their economic activities without worrying about structural necessities. Controlling these services allows corporations to establish dependency relationships with colonies, securing long-term profits and a strategic foothold in planetary politics.

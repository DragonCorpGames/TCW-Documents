# Grant Exploitation

Access to natural resources is a fundamental pillar of expansion and development in any interstellar society. Grants regulate the exclusive rights to extract materials from mineral-rich regions, energy sources, or strategic deposits. Without these resources, manufacturing, infrastructure, and interstellar expansion would be unsustainable.

Corporations operating in this sector must manage prospecting, extraction, transportation, and refinement of raw materials, ensuring a steady flow of essential supplies to the market. This requires building and optimizing mining installations, refineries, and distribution networks, as well as managing logistics costs and security against external incursions.

Controlling a key grant can grant a corporation formidable economic power, allowing it to negotiate from a position of strength or even establish monopolies over essential materials. Those who dominate this sector do not just extract resources—they dictate the pace and price of progress itself.

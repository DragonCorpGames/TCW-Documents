# Grant Exploitation

Access to natural resources is a fundamental pillar in the expansion and development of any society. Grants regulate exclusive rights over regions rich in minerals, energy sources, or strategic materials. Without these resources, manufacturing, infrastructure, and interstellar expansion would be unsustainable.

Corporations operating in this sector must manage the prospecting, extraction, transportation, and processing of raw materials, ensuring a constant flow of supplies to the market. This involves building and optimizing mining facilities, refineries, and distribution networks, as well as managing logistical and security costs against potential external incursions.

Controlling a key concession can give a corporation formidable economic power, allowing it to negotiate from a position of strength â€” or even establish monopolies over certain essential materials.

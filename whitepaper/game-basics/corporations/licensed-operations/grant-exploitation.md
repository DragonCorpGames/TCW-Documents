# Grant Exploitation

Access to natural resources is a fundamental pillar in the expansion and development of any society.

Concessions regulate exclusive rights to regions rich in minerals, energy sources, or strategic materials. Without these resources, manufacturing, infrastructure, and interstellar expansion would be unsustainable.

Corporations operating in this sector must manage the exploration, extraction, transportation, and processing of raw materials, ensuring a constant supply of inputs for the market. This requires the construction and optimization of mining facilities, refineries, and distribution networks, as well as the management of logistical and security costs to prevent potential external incursions.

Controlling a key concession can grant a corporation formidable economic power, allowing it to negotiate from a position of strength or even establish monopolies over essential materials.

# Facilities

Facilities are the operational core of every corporation. They include factories, refineries, space stations, logistics centers, starports, and research laboratories. Their location and efficiency determine the company’s production capacity and potential for expansion, and their development requires investment in infrastructure, security, and technology.

Each type of facility plays a specific role within the corporation’s operational chain — whether in manufacturing, resource exploitation, trade, or defense. Proper management allows corporations to scale production, optimize costs, and increase their responsiveness to market opportunities or threats.

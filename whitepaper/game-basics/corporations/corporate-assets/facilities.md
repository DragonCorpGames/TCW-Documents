# Facilities

Facilities form the operational core of every corporation. They include factories, refineries, space stations, logistics hubs, starports, and research laboratories. Their location and efficiency determine a corporation’s productive capacity and expansion potential, requiring continuous investment in infrastructure, security, and technology to remain competitive.

Each facility type serves a specific function within the corporation’s operational chain—whether in manufacturing, resource exploitation, trade, or defense. Effective facility management allows corporations to scale production, optimize costs, and increase their ability to respond to market opportunities or emerging threats. Those who control critical facilities dictate the economic flow and industrial power of the galaxy.

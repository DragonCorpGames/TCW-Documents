# Corporate Assets

A corporation’s assets determine its ability to operate, expand, and exert influence within the interstellar environment. They are the foundation upon which economic, commercial, and military strategies are built, and their proper management is key to long-term sustainability and growth.

Corporations operate across various market sectors that require specific assets to run their operations: facilities, vehicles and machinery, owned resources, warehouses and energy access, licenses, grants, liquidity — as well as workers and specialized personnel.

The variety of available assets is vast, and it is up to the players to develop strategies for acquiring, maintaining, financing, and implementing their corporation’s assets. Over-acquisition can drain capital and hinder short-term operations, while operating without adequate asset reserves can lead to serious problems during periods of scarcity.

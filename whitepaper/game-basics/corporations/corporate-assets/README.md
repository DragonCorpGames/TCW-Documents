# Corporate Assets

A corporation’s assets determine its ability to operate, expand, and exert influence within the interstellar landscape. These assets form the foundation upon which economic, commercial, and military strategies are built, making their proper management essential for long-term sustainability and growth.

From infrastructure and fleet resources to personnel and exclusive holdings, every asset plays a role in defining a corporation’s competitive edge. Those who efficiently allocate and control their assets will shape trade networks, dominate industrial sectors, and establish themselves as key players in The Corporate Wars.

# Grants and Licenses

Grants and licenses represent exclusive rights granted by regulatory entities or governments, allowing corporations to exploit resources, operate in strategic sectors, or establish facilities in key locations. Obtaining and maintaining these permits is essential for accessing new economic opportunities and avoiding regulatory sanctions.

Corporations can acquire these rights through negotiations, auctions, or political influence, and their control can determine the success or failure of a business in highly competitive sectors. Managing grants strategically enables corporations to block rivals and secure exclusive access to specific markets, turning legal permissions into a powerful tool for expansion and dominance.

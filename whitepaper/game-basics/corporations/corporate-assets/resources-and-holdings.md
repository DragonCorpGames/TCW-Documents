# Resources and Holdings

A corporation’s resources and holdings define its tangible wealth and revenue-generating capacity. These assets include raw material reserves, transport fleets, industrial complexes, and territories acquired through grants.

Controlling large volumes of resources ensures continuous production, stronger negotiation leverage, and the ability to establish monopolies over key materials in the interstellar economy. Efficient management of these holdings is crucial to mitigating losses from obsolescence, speculation, or conflicts with rival entities.

Those who dominate resource control dictate the flow of industrial power and commerce, shaping the very foundation of the galactic economy.

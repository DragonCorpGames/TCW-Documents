# Staff and Crew

Human capital is a critical component of any corporate operation. From executives and factory workers to specialized technicians and starship crews, every individual plays a role in maintaining the sustainability and efficiency of the enterprise.

Corporations must recruit, train, and retain skilled personnel, ensuring that each sector is staffed appropriately. Morale, loyalty, and expertise directly impact operational performance, and in times of crisis, having an experienced team can mean the difference between stability and total collapse.

# The Charted Space

The Charted Space is the portion of the galaxy that has been mapped, colonized, or influenced by interstellar civilizations. It is here that exploration, trade, and politics converge, shaping the balance of power between major powers, corporations, and autonomous entities.

The extent of Charted Space is not uniform; some regions are densely populated and highly developed, featuring established trade routes and a consolidated infrastructure, while others remain disputed frontiers, where authority is weak and external forces can shift the balance of power.

Within this vast expanse, players will encounter key worlds, strategic sectors, and vital trade networks. However, beyond the limits of Charted Space lie unexplored regions, undiscovered systems, and isolated zones where civilization is scarce or nonexistent. Expansion into these territories presents both opportunities and challenges, as the absence of control can mean freedom or danger in equal measure.

Understanding Charted Space is essential for any corporation seeking to grow and consolidate power in the galaxy. Controlling access to resource-rich regions, dominating trade routes, and securing footholds in strategic locations can be the difference between success and obsolescence.

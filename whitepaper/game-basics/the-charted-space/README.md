# The Charted Space

**The Charted Space** is the portion of the galaxy that has been mapped, colonized, or influenced by interstellar civilizations. It is here where exploration, trade, and politics intertwine, defining the balance of power between major powers, corporations, and autonomous entities.

The extent of Charted Space is not uniform; some regions are densely populated and highly developed, with established trade routes and consolidated infrastructure, while others are contested frontiers where authority is weak and the presence of external actors can shift the balance of power.

Within this territory, players will find key worlds, strategic sectors, and vital trade routes. However, beyond the borders of Charted Space lie unexplored regions, undiscovered systems, and areas where civilization is scarce or nonexistent. Expansion into these territories presents both an opportunity and a challenge â€” the absence of control can mean either freedom or danger.

Understanding Charted Space is essential for any corporation seeking to grow and consolidate its power in the galaxy. Controlling access to resource-rich regions, dominating trade routes, and establishing enclaves in strategic locations can be the difference between success and obsolescence.

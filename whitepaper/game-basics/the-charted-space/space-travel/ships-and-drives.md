# Ships and Drives

Interstellar transport in The Corporate Wars relies on a combination of advanced propulsion technology and ship designs optimized for various functions. From massive freighters to light exploration vessels, each type of ship plays a fundamental role in galactic mobility and interstellar commerce.

Drives are the core of any starship, determining its speed, range, and operational efficiency. While impulse engines allow navigation within a star system, the interstellar jump capacitor is the only means of traveling between stars within manageable timeframes. Access to different propulsion technologies defines a fleet’s competitiveness and its ability to operate in trade, warfare, or exploration.

Corporations that dominate the manufacturing, maintenance, and supply of drives and propulsion systems do not simply control the movement of goods and people—they also influence interstellar geopolitics, establishing transportation networks that can consolidate or destabilize entire regions.

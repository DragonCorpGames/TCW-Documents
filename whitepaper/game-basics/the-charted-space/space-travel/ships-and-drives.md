# Ships and Drives

Interstellar transportation in **The Corporate Wars** relies on a combination of advanced propulsion technology and starship designs optimized for specific roles. From massive freighters to light exploration vessels, each type of ship plays a vital role in galactic mobility and the inter-system economy.

Reactors are the heart of any ship, determining its speed, range, and operational efficiency. While impulse engines enable navigation within a star system, the interstellar jump capacitor is the only way to travel between stars within manageable timeframes. Access to different levels of propulsion technology defines a fleet’s competitiveness and its ability to operate in trade, warfare, or exploration.

Corporations that dominate the manufacturing, maintenance, and supply of reactors and propulsion systems not only control the flow of goods and people across the galaxy but also influence interstellar geopolitics — establishing transportation networks that can either consolidate or destabilize entire regions.

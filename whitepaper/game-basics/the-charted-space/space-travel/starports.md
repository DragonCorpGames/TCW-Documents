# Starports

Starports are the essential nodes of space travel in The Corporate Wars. More than just landing facilities, they are critical hubs where ships refuel, contracts are negotiated, and civilizations interact. From high-tech orbital stations to rudimentary outposts on remote worlds, each starport plays a distinct role in the interstellar trade and transport network.

The quality and capacity of a starport determine its economic relevance within the galaxy. Some serve as luxurious enclaves, featuring elite facilities for the galaxy’s upper class, while others are dangerous transit points, where pirates and shady merchants mix in search of opportunity and profit. Regardless of their status, starports are fundamental to the economic and political landscape of any system.

For corporations, controlling or influencing a starport means dominating the flow of goods and passengers, setting customs tariffs, ensuring operational security, and restricting access to competitors. Those with the resources to develop or manage these logistical hubs can consolidate power and monopolize key sectors of the interstellar trade network.

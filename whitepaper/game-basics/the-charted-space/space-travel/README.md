# Space Travel

Space travel is the backbone of interstellar civilization in **The Corporate Wars**. The ability to move people, goods, and data across the vast expanses of space is what keeps the economy running, enables territorial expansion, and defines relationships between worlds and civilizations.

Since faster-than-light communication does not exist, starships are the only means of transmitting information and coordinating large-scale operations. Every transit between systems is a strategic event, where travel time, navigation conditions, and route security play a crucial role in the stability of societies and commerce.

Space routes are determined by the accessibility of star systems and the presence of infrastructure such as spaceports and refueling stations. Some regions feature well-established corridors with frequent and secure traffic, while others are high-risk zones due to pirate activity, interstellar conflicts, or hazardous space conditions.

For corporations, mastering space travel means not only optimizing logistics but also securing control over strategic routes. Accessing the best trade corridors, ensuring the protection of their convoys, and establishing transportation monopolies can be the difference between a profitable operation and one doomed to failure.

# Space Travel

Space travel is the lifeblood of interstellar civilization in The Corporate Wars. The ability to move people, goods, and data across the vastness of space sustains the economy, enables territorial expansion, and defines relations between worlds and civilizations.

Since faster-than-light communication does not exist, starships are the only means of transmitting information and coordinating large-scale operations. Every system-to-system transit is a strategic event, where travel time, navigational conditions, and route security play a crucial role in maintaining societal stability and economic flow.

Space routes are determined by stellar system accessibility and the presence of key infrastructure, such as starports and refueling stations. Some regions benefit from well-established corridors, where transit is frequent and secure, while others are high-risk zones, plagued by piracy, interstellar conflicts, or hazardous space conditions.

For corporations, mastering space travel is not just about logistical optimization—it’s about securing control over strategic routes. Accessing the best trade corridors, protecting convoys, and monopolizing transportation networks can be the difference between a profitable enterprise and a doomed operation.

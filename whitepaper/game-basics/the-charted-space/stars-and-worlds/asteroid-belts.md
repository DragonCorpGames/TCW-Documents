# Asteroid Belts

Asteroid belts are dense regions of rock and metal debris within a star system, remnants of planetary formation. Though inhospitable to life, these fields of fragmented material are vital to the interstellar economy, containing high concentrations of essential minerals for manufacturing and space infrastructure development.

Corporations exploit asteroid belts through mining stations and automated extraction fleets, processing asteroids for valuable materials such as heavy metals, rare earth elements, and compounds used in advanced technologies. The low-gravity environment makes mining in these zones far more efficient than planetary extraction, allowing cheaper transportation of raw resources across the galaxy.

Beyond their industrial value, asteroid belts serve as strategic locations for hidden bases, pirate refuges, and covert military installations. Their fragmented nature and constant movement make detection and access difficult, turning them into ideal territories for off-the-grid operations beyond the supervision of major interstellar powers.

Controlling a key asteroid belt grants a corporation a major advantage in the trade of critical materials, ensuring a steady supply for industrial expansion and fleet production. In a universe where resources dictate power, these rich, contested regions are both a source of wealth and battlegrounds for corporate dominance.

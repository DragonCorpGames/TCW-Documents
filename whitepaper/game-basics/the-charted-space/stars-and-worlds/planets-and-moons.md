# Planets and Moons

Worlds are the foundation of interstellar civilization in The Corporate Wars. From fertile, habitable planets to toxic wastelands and frozen moons, each celestial body presents unique opportunities and challenges for expansion, resource exploitation, and colony establishment.

Some worlds naturally support life and society without the need for advanced infrastructure, while others require pressurized habitats, partial terraforming, or specialized technology to sustain settlements. Despite their differences, all worlds hold strategic value based on their location, accessibility, and resource wealth.

Moons, though smaller, can be just as crucial as planets. Their low gravity and proximity to major celestial bodies make them prime locations for industrial operations, trade hubs, and military outposts. Many corporations establish mining complexes, transit stations, and operational bases on moons, leveraging their strategic positions to control trade routes or extract hard-to-reach materials.

Controlling a well-positioned world can secure regional dominance, whether as an industrial center, logistical hub, or military enclave. In a galaxy where mobility and resource control dictate power, choosing which worlds to colonize and how to manage them is one of the most critical strategic decisions a corporation can make.

# Planets and Moons

Worlds are the foundation of interstellar civilization in **The Corporate Wars**. From fertile, habitable planets to toxic deserts and frozen moons, each celestial body presents its own set of opportunities and challenges for expansion, resource exploitation, and colony establishment.

Some worlds offer naturally favorable conditions for life, allowing societies to develop without the need for advanced infrastructure, while others require the implementation of pressurized habitats, partial terraforming, or specialized technology to sustain settlements. Despite their differences, all worlds hold strategic value determined by their location, accessibility, and resource wealth.

Moons, though smaller in size, can be just as crucial as planets. Their low gravity and proximity to other celestial bodies make them key points for industry, trade, and defense. Many corporations establish mining complexes, transit stations, and operational bases on moons, using their position to control trade routes or extract hard-to-reach materials.

Controlling a well-positioned world can mean dominance over an entire region — as an industrial hub, logistical node, or military stronghold. In a setting where mobility and resources dictate power, choosing which worlds to colonize and how to manage them is one of the most important strategic decisions in the galaxy.

# Stars and Worlds

The universe of The Corporate Wars is composed of countless planetary systems, each with its own combination of stars, planets, moons, and smaller celestial bodies. These systems form the foundation of interstellar expansion, shaping the economic, strategic, and political landscape of the galaxy.

Stars define the nature of a system. From long-lived red dwarfs to short-lived blue giants, each type of star influences habitability and resource availability. Systems with multiple suns present additional challenges for navigation and colonization due to their complex orbital mechanics.

Habitable worlds are scarce and invaluable. While many planets can sustain colonization through terraforming or artificial habitats, discovering a world with naturally favorable conditions is a strategic asset. However, habitability is not everything—arid, frozen, or gaseous worlds can be crucial sources of industrial and energy resources.

Beyond planets, moons and asteroid belts play a key role in the galactic economy. These regions can host mining operations, space stations, and serve as transit points along trade routes. Many corporations establish strategic footholds in these areas, leveraging their mineral wealth and logistical advantages.

Understanding the distribution and characteristics of planetary systems is essential for any corporation seeking expansion. Controlling a resource-rich system or securing access to key trade routes can establish economic dominance in a sector, while poor positioning or miscalculated expansion can doom an operation to irrelevance or failure.

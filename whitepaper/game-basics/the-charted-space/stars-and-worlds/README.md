# Stars and Worlds

The universe of **The Corporate Wars** is made up of countless planetary systems, each with its own combination of stars, planets, moons, and minor celestial bodies. These systems form the foundation of interstellar expansion, shaping the galaxy's economic, strategic, and political opportunities.

Stars define the nature of a system. From long-lived red dwarfs to short-lived blue giants, each stellar type influences habitability and available resources. Systems with multiple suns may pose additional challenges for navigation and colonization due to their complex orbits.

Habitable worlds are rare and valuable. While many planets can host colonies through terraforming or artificial habitats, finding a world with naturally favorable conditions is a strategic asset. However, habitability isn’t everything — arid, frozen, or gaseous worlds can serve as crucial sources of industrial and energy resources.

Beyond planets, moons and asteroid belts play a key role in the galactic economy. These regions can host mining outposts, space stations, and serve as transit points along trade routes. Many corporations establish operations in these environments, taking advantage of their mineral wealth and strategic locations.

Understanding the distribution and characteristics of planetary systems is essential for any corporation seeking expansion. Controlling a system rich in resources or with access to vital trade routes can mean economic dominance in a sector, while choosing a poorly located world could doom an operation to failure.

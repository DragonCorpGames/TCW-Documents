# Gas Giants

Gas giants are massive planetary bodies composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, lacking a defined solid surface. Though inhospitable for traditional colonization, these worlds are critical to interstellar infrastructure due to their atmospheric wealth of exploitable elements.

Operations on gas giants typically focus on the extraction of fuels, such as refined hydrogen for fusion reactors and exotic gases used in various industrial and technological applications. Atmospheric harvesting platforms and floating stations allow corporations to collect these resources without requiring surface installations, significantly reducing operational and maintenance costs.

Many gas giants have mineral-rich moons or habitable satellites, making them economic hubs within a star system. Additionally, gravitational or atmospheric anomalies can turn these planets into strategic points for trade, fleet transit, or even covert installations operating beyond the reach of interstellar authorities.

Access and control over a key gas giant can mean the difference between a stable fuel supply network and costly reliance on external providers. In a universe where mobility is essential, dominating the production and distribution of fuel makes these worlds some of the most strategically valuable assets in the galaxy.
